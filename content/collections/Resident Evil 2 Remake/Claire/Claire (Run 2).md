- FAQ of the Month Winner: November 2019

## Walkthrough

- [ ] Choose "New Game [2nd Run]" / "Claire Redfield" from the main menu and select your chosen difficulty.
- [ ] After the cutscenes you will find yourself in a graveyard.
- [ ] You have your SLS-60 pistol and a measly three rounds.
- [ ] Continue through the passage past the chained-up door on your right and go up the stairs on the other side.
- [ ] Pick up the Red Herb at the top of the stairs and the Blue Herb slightly further ahead on the right.
- [ ] You may only have three bullets but that doesn't mean you can't make them count.
- [ ] Look for the female corpse sitting down just past the opening where you picked up the Blue Herb and put three bullets into her skull - you might get a lucky shot.
- [ ] Continue around the corner and look for a wheelbarrow containing the Cutting Tool.
- [ ] Pick it up for a familiar cutscene.
- [ ] Afterwards, the bodies lying round will start getting up.
- [ ] Despite this, you should have no problem making your way back to the door you ignored earlier.
- [ ] Use the Cutting Tool on the chain and go inside.
- [ ] Grab the Courtyard Key from the locker.
- [ ] There's Large-Caliber Handgun Ammo x 10 to your right.
- [ ] Look on the desk for the Quickdraw Army Pistol and don't miss the Hand Grenade on the radiator.
- [ ] Use the item box.
- [ ] Your SLS-60 is kinda useless - additional ammunition can only be made for the time being - so put it away.
- [ ] I'm not a fan of the Quickdraw Army either.
- [ ] It fires quickly and does decent damage but the reload time is horrendous.
- [ ] Needs must, however.
- [ ] Leave when you're ready.
- [ ] You need to return to where you picked up the Cutting Tool.
- [ ] You will have four or five zombies to deal with on the way.
- [ ] You have reasonable lines of fire to kneecap them as they advance or, if they bunch up, you can take them out with the Hand Grenade.
- [ ] Return to the gate and use the Courtyard Key which you can now discard.
- [ ] Once through the gate, pick up the Large-Caliber Ammo and some Wooden Boards and go through the door.
- [ ] If you got chewed up on your way, there is a First Aid Spray in one of the stalls in the nearby Bathroom.
- [ ] Turn right and go into the Watchman's Room.
- [ ] The upper half of Elliot is crawling around and he'll chew your leg given half a chance.
- [ ] Since you'll need to come though a few times, take the time to put him down.
- [ ] Pick up the Scrap Paper from the desk and leave through the north.
- [ ] There's a Combat Knife sticking out of the wall so help yourself.
- [ ] Make your way north to the Break Room.
- [ ] Pick up the Flame Rounds x 2 from the shelf nearby and go inside.
- [ ] You may need to unload stuff into the item box to get everything from here.
- [ ] There's a Blue Herb on the desk, Large-Caliber Ammo x 8 in a locker and High Grade Gunpowder in the locker next to it.
- [ ] The room to the rear has Submachine Gun Ammo x 50 on the sink and an Electrical Part on the chair.
- [ ] Use the item box again and save your game.
- [ ] Head back through the Watchman's Room.
- [ ] A zombie will break through the window in front of you and you'll need to deal with it.
- [ ] Afterwards, use the Cutting Tool on the door to the East Office and take out the zombie inside.
- [ ] Use the Wooden Boards to block the window and begin looting.
- [ ] There's a Green Herb near the door and a Flash Grenade nearby.
- [ ] You can find Large-Caliber Ammo x 5 on the corpse near the window.
- [ ] The large desk has some Gunpowder.
- [ ] Inside the private office area is High Grade Gunpowder and the Round Handle.
- [ ] Unblock the door leading west and go out into the hall.
- [ ] Use the Electrical Part on the nearby fuse box.
- [ ] This not only raises the shutter but handily frees up a slot in your inventory.
- [ ] Go north to the cupboard to pick up some more Wooden Boards and there's also Large-Caliber Ammo x 5 if you're so inclined.
- [ ] Head back south and go into the Main Hall.
- [ ] Be careful because there's a zombie just inside.
- [ ] On the desk is a Hip Pouch and Large-Caliber Ammo x 3.
- [ ] Pick up the can of First Aid Spray from the boxes nearby if you have room.
- [ ] Go behind the desk to find Marvin shuffling around and put an end to his misery.
- [ ] You'll find the notebook on the couch nearby that gives you the solutions to the Goddess Statue puzzle.
- [ ] Another zombie may wander down from the level above - if so, deal with her.
- [ ] Go west into Reception.
- [ ] There's a Green Herb here and Large-Caliber Ammo x 6.
- [ ] When you get to the corridor outside, walk.
- [ ] Very.
- [ ] Slowly.
- [ ] There's a Licker here.
- [ ] Go round the corner and enter the Operations Room.
- [ ] Grab the Police Station 1F Map off the board.
- [ ] You can cut the chain on the southern door here and discard the Cutting Tool.
- [ ] Inside, look on the table for the Electronic Gadget.
- [ ] There's also Wooden Boards and a Green Herb in here if you want them, along with a Flash Grenade.
- [ ] Unlock the door to the corridor outside and take care of the fat zombie banging on the vending machine.
- [ ] Ignore the Safety Deposit Room for the time being and make your way north towards the stairs and the Dark Room.
- [ ] A zombie will come through the window as you approach so take him down.
- [ ] Go into the Dark Room and drop stuff off - store the Electronic Gadget for the time being along with your Flash Grenades.
- [ ] You want to have six free slots and a single Blue Herb in your inventory (trust me).
- [ ] There is Gunpowder and Large-Calibre Ammo x 2 in the lockers and a Red Herb in the back room that you can put in the item box.
- [ ] Save your game.
- [ ] If you didn't deal with them already, there are two zombies outside.
- [ ] Put them down because you'll be coming back here.
- [ ] Go upstairs to the first floor.
- [ ] You can pick up Large-Caliber Ammo x 3.
- [ ] Go past the door to find a Red Herb and then go into the shower room.
- [ ] As you go in look to your right to find a Box.
- [ ] The lockers in here contain Flame Rounds x 4 (one requires the combination "CAP"), but I'd leave them where they are for the time being because of limited inventory space.
- [ ] Use your Round Handle on the shower vent to shut off steam.
- [ ] Go back out and go upstairs to the third floor and put down the zombie here.
- [ ] The locker uses the combination "DCM" and contains Submachine Gun Ammo x 100.
- [ ] Again, leave it where it is.
- [ ] Instead, go into the office and grab up the Spade Key from the desk.
- [ ] Leave though the door and follow the corridor around to the West Storage Room.
- [ ] Pick up the Wooden Boards and go through to the Library.
- [ ] Go across the wooden bridge and down the stairs.
- [ ] There's a zombie at the bottom whom you should kill.
- [ ] Take a moment or two to kill the fat zombie sitting near the Spade Door.
- [ ] There is a Combat Knife on the floor by one of the dead cops near the Lounge door.
- [ ] For the moment, just make a note of it.
- [ ] Afterwards, go into the Lounge.
- [ ] Pick up the Police Station Upper Floors Map from the notice board and examine the Unicorn Statue.
- [ ] Turn the dials to read Twins, Scales, Worm to receive the Unicorn Medallion.
- [ ] Ignore the Yellow Box on the table; it contains a strip of Roll Film that we do not need.
- [ ] Return to the library and go to where the moveable bookshelves are.
- [ ] There's a zombie feeding whom you should kill.
- [ ] Look at the rightmost bookcase and move it one to the left.
- [ ] Move the leftmost two one space to the right.
- [ ] This will save time later.
- [ ] Pick up the Large-Caliber Ammo x 6 from behind the leftmost bookcase.
- [ ] Pick up the Red Book near the Spade Door, unlock it and go through.
- [ ] Go right initially to find Large-Caliber Ammo x 3 at the end of the landing.
- [ ] Go downstairs and place your Unicorn Medallion in the Goddess Statue and unlock the West Office door.
- [ ] Go up the other staircase and make your way to the Waiting Room.
- [ ] Pick up the Green Herb but ignore the safe - it contains a weapon upgrade we don't need.
- [ ] Unlock the Spade Door, discard the key and go though.
- [ ] Be careful because there are two zombies in this hallway.
- [ ] After you've taken care of them, grab the Wooden Boards at the end of the corridor.
- [ ] Go into the Art Room and grab the Weapons Locker Key Card from the table.
- [ ] Go over to the other table and use the Red Book with the Statue Arm.
- [ ] Pick up the Arm With Book and use it on the statue to receive a Scepter.
- [ ] This will cause a Licker to spawn into the room.
- [ ] If you can get out unscratched, more power to you.
- [ ] But get out of there.
- [ ] Once safe, examine the Scepter to receive the Red Jewel.
- [ ] Combine it with the Box in your inventory to receive the S.T.A.R.S.
- [ ] Badge.
- [ ] Go back through the Waiting Room.
- [ ] Pick up the Green Herb if you haven't done already, go to the landing and examine the Lion Statue.
- [ ] Turn the dials to read Crown, Fire, Dove to receive the Lion Medallion.
- [ ] Go down the stairs and place the Lion and Medallion in the Goddess Statue.
- [ ] Two down.
- [ ] You should now have space for the First Aid Spray nearby if you didn't pick it up earlier.
- [ ] Put in your inventory (or use it if you took a good clawing from the Licker upstairs).
- [ ] Go into the West Office.
- [ ] Just inside the office is the puzzle desk.
- [ ] Read the note on top and then use "NED" for the left lock and "MRG" for the other.
- [ ] Pick up the Speed Loader (SLS-60) accessory from inside.
- [ ] There is a zombie inside the private office area who will need to be taken out.
- [ ] Afterwards, open the safe.
- [ ] The combination is L9, R15, L7 - you should end up on the 1.
- [ ] Grab the Hip Pouch to give yourself two more item slots.
- [ ] On your way back to the door, grab Large-Caliber Ammo x2 from a locker in the corner if you want it along with the Gunpowder on the table.
- [ ] Leave the West Office.
- [ ] There may be a zombie outside in the corridor whom you should be wary of.
- [ ] Go into the Safety Deposit Room and enter 109 on the keypad to unlock a locker containing Large-Caliber Ammo.
- [ ] Use the Weapons Locker Key Card on the locker at the back and grab the GM 79 Grenade Launcher and the Flame Rounds x 2 inside.
- [ ] Take a moment to switch weapons and load ammo into your grenade launcher.
- [ ] Return to the Dark Room to dump any stuff that you don't need.
- [ ] Leave healing items behind (trust me).
- [ ] Keep the S.T.A.R.S.
- [ ] Badge and pick up the Electronic Gadget along with your Flame Rounds and any Flash Grenades you may have.
- [ ] Save your game.
- [ ] Go upstairs to the first floor.
- [ ] Grab the two lots of Flame Rounds from the lockers that you ignored earlier and go through the shower room.
- [ ] There's some Gunpowder in a locker which you'll want to pick up.
- [ ] Head though the door to the corridor beyond and pick up the Flame Rounds x 2 from the sofa.
- [ ] Go into the S.T.A.R.S.
- [ ] Office and loot.
- [ ] There's a Red Herb just inside the door.
- [ ] Go inside the room to find some High Grade Gunpowder on a desk.
- [ ] Look in the nearby pouch hanging from the wall to find a First Aid Spray.
- [ ] There are Flame Rounds x 2 on another desk and Large-Caliber Hand Ammo x 6 on a trolley at the back of the room.
- [ ] Look on the same trolley for a file Leon's Memo (57/58).
- [ ] Examine the S.T.A.R.S.
- [ ] Badge in your inventory to reveal a USB connector.
- [ ] Place it in the tower PC on the desk and then use the keyboard next to it to open the Armory where you'll find the MQ 11 Submachine Gun.
- [ ] Remember to pick up your Badge from the PC.
- [ ] Go into the private office area and get the Battery from the desk.
- [ ] Combine it with the Electronic Gadget to create a Detonator.
- [ ] Now leave the office and head back through the showers (do not go south).
- [ ] Go upstairs and pick up the Submachine Gun Ammo from the locker.
- [ ] You may hear some familiar footsteps behind you - don't panic.
- [ ] Go into the Western Storage Room, use the Detonator on the C4 and retreat to the library until you hear the explosion.
- [ ] Go back into the Western Storeroom and examine the Maiden Statue.
- [ ] Turn the dials to read Ram, Harp, Bird to receive the Maiden Medallion.
- [ ] While you were solving the puzzle, Mr.
- [ ] X may well have entered the Western Storeroom to try and stop you.
- [ ] If so, throw a Flash Grenade at his feet and run into the library.
- [ ] The quickest way down is to go left and down the ladder.
- [ ] Run through the Spade Door to the Main Hall landing, run downstairs and place the final medallion in the Goddess Statue.
- [ ] Go to the safe room underneath, pick up the Flame Rounds x 2 and Gunpowder that you can find on the desks, use the item box and save your game.
- [ ] Keep the S.T.A.R.S.
- [ ] Badge and the MQ 11.
- [ ] Make your way to the exit and take the lift down.
- [ ] Go down two flights of stairs to an old storeroom.
- [ ] Pick up the Hand Grenade from the floor and check out the locked cabinet.
- [ ] Examine your S.T.A.R.S.
- [ ] Badge and retract the USB connector if you've not done so already.
- [ ] Use the badge on the cabinet to unlock it and retrieve the Suppressor (MQ 11) accessory that you can combine with your SMG right away.
- [ ] Go back upstairs to the first landing and go through the open door.
- [ ] Follow the path round until your way is blocked by a fallen filing cabinet.
- [ ] Move it out of the way to trigger a cutscene and your first boss encounter with William Birkin in his G-1 form.
- [ ] At the start of the fight, you can get a few good slashes in with your combat knife.
- [ ] Afterwards, keep your distance and shoot him when you're not in danger, preferably in the head.
- [ ] When the large eyeball appears from his shoulder, shoot that, preferably with your SMG.
- [ ] If he grabs you, you will stab him in the eyeball with your Combat Knife.
- [ ] If he grabs you when you don't have any secondary weapons, he'll probably take you down into the red zone - use a healing item ASAP.
- [ ] Kite him around the walkways but use your map to ensure that you don't end up in a corner room when he's nearby - he'll trap you and you'll take a beating.
- [ ] Afterwards, the girl we saw in the cutscene will drop a ladder down for us.
- [ ] Before going up, you may want to stock up on resources.
- [ ] Start with the bottom right corner room and grab Large-Caliber Ammo x 8 and a Green Herb.
- [ ] Move onto the lower left and help yourself to the Red Herb and Large-Caliber Ammo x 7.
- [ ] Finally, go the upper right room and retrieve the Large-Caliber Ammo x 7, Hand Grenade and a Green Herb.
- [ ] When you're done looting, climb up the ladder in the north of the area to get back onto the walkways.
- [ ] Go into the room on your right.
- [ ] Grab the Gunpowder from the lockers and a Green Herb.
- [ ] Run west and up the stairs.
- [ ] As you go through the next room, pull a lever to activate a bridge.
- [ ] Go across and follow the walkway to the Operators Room.
- [ ] Grab the Hip Pouch from the locker, use the item box (I kept Gunpowder and a G+R Herb) and save your game.
- [ ] Leave this room via the ladder leading up.
- [ ] After a brief cutscene you will be in the Parking Garage.
- [ ] Run over to the grille blocking the exit, investigate the card reader and cancel out for a cutscene where you're introduced to the truly awful Chief Irons.
- [ ] After the cutscene, leave through the eastern door.
- [ ] This next section can be kinda brutal; don't be afraid to replay this section if things go badly.
- [ ] Turn right and head south and follow the passage round until you find a Blue Herb.
- [ ] Arm yourself with the Grenade Launcher before opening the nearby door.
- [ ] There's a Licker just inside feeding on a dead dog and another just past the kennels.
- [ ] You'll have to deal with them now or on the way back - a Flame Round followed by a few shots from your pistol will do the trick.
- [ ] After killing the first, back out of the room to reload and then go back inside and deal with the other.
- [ ] Just inside the door is a High Grade Gunpowder.
- [ ] Run round to the other exit and leave.
- [ ] Back out in the corridor, go through the nearby door to the Morgue.
- [ ] There's a zombie near the door pretending to be dead; you may want to kill him to prevent problems shortly - shoot a leg off first because he's an absolute bullet sponge.
- [ ] There's a Red Herb in the second drawer along and a Flash Grenade in the last drawer.
- [ ] Make sure you close it afterwards.
- [ ] Finally, check out the second from last drawer on the other side.
- [ ] Pull out the drawer and grab the Diamond Key.
- [ ] The corpse next to it will come to life.
- [ ] Rather than killing it, just get out of here as quickly as you can.
- [ ] Return through the Kennels and be careful when you go back out into the corridor because there's another Licker to deal with or avoid.
- [ ] This next section is optional because it leads to the JMB Hp3 handgun which isn't particularly useful in this scenario (it wasn't that useful in the A-scenario either).
- [ ] When you get to the top of the corridor, don't return to the Parking Garage just yet.
- [ ] Instead, go west and through the door to the Firing Range.
- [ ] Look for a yellow box on the counter.
- [ ] Pick it up and examine it in your inventory for the Well Worn Key.
- [ ] Unlock the door in the north with your Diamond Key.
- [ ] The main reason to do so is to be able to discard the key later.
- [ ] Pick up the Red Herb inside but ignore the Roll Film.
- [ ] Be careful if you decide to explore the Firing Range area proper - there are two police zombies lurking just inside the door.
- [ ] Go inside to find Flame Rounds x 2 near the counter.
- [ ] Return to the Parking Garage and examine the Well Worn Key in your inventory and turn it round to reveal a button.
- [ ] Press it to unlock the boot of the black and white police cruiser.
- [ ] Discard the key.
- [ ] Inside the boot is the JMB Hp3 pistol.
- [ ] Back in the parking garage, make your way to the northern door that Chief Irons came out of.
- [ ] Head north and grab the Police Station B1 Map from the wall.
- [ ] Unlock the nearby door with your Diamond Key.
- [ ] Look in the locker for the Shoulder Stock (GM 79) accessory.
- [ ] There's also High Grade Gunpowder and a Blue Herb.
- [ ] Pull the lever when you're done looting.
- [ ] Leave the room and use the nearby elevator.
- [ ] When it gets to the top, pick up the Green Herb (you should have the makings of a G+R+B Herb) and go back inside the police station.
- [ ] You will emerge in the Chief's Office.
- [ ] Look on a table for Submachine Gun Ammo x 50.
- [ ] Afterwards, use the item box and pick up any Wooden Boards that you may have.
- [ ] The exit to the main part of the station is locked.
- [ ] Go though the other exit and follow it round to the Private Collection Room.
- [ ] Pick up the High Grade Gunpowder from just inside the door.
- [ ] The Parking Garage Key Card is locked behind bars and the electrical puzzle.
- [ ] Continue round and pick up the Relief from a table.
- [ ] Examine it in your inventory to reveal the Heart Key.
- [ ] Return to the Chief's Office, save your game, use the Heart Key to unlock the door leading back into the police station and leave.
- [ ] Head down the stairs near the office door.
- [ ] When you get to the bottom, you'll see a zombie trying to break through the window.
- [ ] Use your Wooden Boards if you have some.
- [ ] At the end of the corridor, get the High Grade Gunpowder from a locker and then use the Heart Key on the door at the end of the corridor.
- [ ] Inside, pick up Large-Caliber Ammo x 7 and look on the shelves for a Portable Safe containing a Spare Part for the Safety Deposit Room keypad.
- [ ] After you pick up the Portable Safe, a Licker will come crashing through the Observation Window so get out of the room as quickly as you can and return upstairs.
- [ ] You'll want about five slots clear in your inventory so use the item box if need be.
- [ ] You'll pick up a Combat Knife and various herbs shortly so you may want to dump these.
- [ ] Go up to the top floor.
- [ ] At the top of the stairs are some Wooden Boards and a Flash Grenade in one locker and Large-Caliber Ammo x 8 in another.
- [ ] Go through the western door to the East Storeroom.
- [ ] There is a zombie to your left whom you will need to take down.
- [ ] He will shortly be joined by another.
- [ ] In the room you can find a Blue Herb, Flame Rounds x 2 and the Large Gear.
- [ ] Near to where you encountered the zombies is a Heart Key door.
- [ ] Inside, you'll find a Combat Knife and an orange box that you can examine in your inventory to give you an Electronic Part that you need for the puzzle in the Private Collection Room.
- [ ] Afterwards, your inventory is likely to be full so dump stuff in the item box again.
- [ ] You don't need the Large Gear or the Electronic Part for sure.
- [ ] Head back upstairs and go out through the other door on the balcony.
- [ ] Pick up a Blue Herb and climb down the ladder.
- [ ] Head down the stairs.
- [ ] There are a couple of zombies wandering around down here.
- [ ] The one near the stairs is an immediate threat - shoot her and go back up the stairs to avoid getting chewed.
- [ ] You can pick up a couple of Green Herbs from the area in which she was lurking.
- [ ] Head west and look for a lever that you can turn.
- [ ] Flip it and run back past any still-shambling zombies and go back upstairs.
- [ ] You may be able to pick up the Green Herbs on the way if you've not done so already.
- [ ] Return to the burning helicopter wreck and flip the lever nearby to douse the flames.
- [ ] Go through the nearby door and pick up the Red Herb just inside.
- [ ] Go round the corner to see Mr.
- [ ] X kindly clearing the wreckage for you.
- [ ] Remember that there are certain rooms that he will not enter which you can use to your advantage.
- [ ] Safe Rooms and Mr.
- [ ] X The following rooms accessible from here are safe (i.e.
- [ ] Mr.
- [ ] X won't enter): Chief's Office Break Room Safe Room under the Goddess Statue Dark Room Interrogation Room / Observation Room S.T.A.R.S.
- [ ] Office Clock Tower If you're able to get to one of these rooms, you can just wait him out - he gets bored after a while and stomps off.
- [ ] Wait for his footsteps to fade and you're good to go.
- [ ] Run back outside and when Mr.
- [ ] X follows you, dodge past him and go back inside.
- [ ] Head west and north and go through the Waiting Room.
- [ ] Run around the balcony and go into the Library.
- [ ] We need to get to the Linen Room.
- [ ] Unfortunately, Mr.
- [ ] X stopped us from opening up the direct route when we were here earlier.
- [ ] Head up the ladder to the third floor and into the West Storage Room.
- [ ] This is not a healthy place to be since there's a zombie and a Licker in here so don't hang around.
- [ ] Hopefully, you'll avoid getting clawed.
- [ ] From here, go downstairs and through the shower past the S.T.A.R.S.
- [ ] Office.
- [ ] In this corridor, you can now open up the Linen Room using the Diamond Key.
- [ ] Pick up some Gunpowder and a Portable Safe.
- [ ] This contains the other Spare Part.
- [ ] You may want to open up the way to the Lounge at the end of the corridor.
- [ ] Turn round and and head back past the S.T.A.R.S.
- [ ] Office.
- [ ] Go north through the Shower Room.
- [ ] Go downstairs and into the Dark Room to use the item box - you'll want the Large Gear and Electronic Part but you can stash the Diamond Key if you still have it - and save.
- [ ] Open up the Portable Safe to retrieve the second Spare Part.
- [ ] Leave the Dark Room and take care in the hall outside since there is a Licker patrolling.
- [ ] I would use a Flame Round to get rid of it.
- [ ] When it's dealt with, go into the Safety Deposit Room and use your Spare Parts on the keypad.
- [ ] The best codes to use are 203, which gives you a Hip Pouch, and 208 for some Flame Rounds.
- [ ] Other valid codes are 102, 103 (Combat Knife), 106 and 109 (Large-Caliber Ammo).
- [ ] Leave the Safety Deposit Room and go east into the Operations Room.
- [ ] Use the Heart Key on the door to the south and discard it.
- [ ] Inside, pick up the Tool, a Hand Grenade and some Gunpowder.
- [ ] Mr.
- [ ] X may catch up with you here.
- [ ] Let him chase you around the central bit and leave via the way you come in.
- [ ] Duck into the nearby West Office and go through to the Main Hall.
- [ ] Go up the stairs and into the Library.
- [ ] Look for the row of moveable bookshelves.
- [ ] One of them cannot be moved because it's raised on some sort of trolley device.
- [ ] Use the Tool that you picked up a minute ago to free it.
- [ ] Grab the leftmost bookcase and move it to the right once (our earlier preparations paid off here).
- [ ] If Mr.
- [ ] X interrupts you, run through the Lounge and up to the S.T.A.R.S.
- [ ] Office, wait for him to go away and return to the Library to resume your task.
- [ ] Moving the shelves forms a bridge under the broken walkway above you.
- [ ] Quickly climb the ladder to the upper walkway and exit through the now-accessible door to the east.
- [ ] You will find yourself on a third floor balcony overlooking the Main Hall.
- [ ] Go all the way south.
- [ ] There will probably be a couple of zombies hanging around the door - I used a Flame Round on them.
- [ ] Enter the door to your right to find yourself in the Clock Tower.
- [ ] You are safe here.
- [ ] Look for a mechanism with cogs in the corner.
- [ ] Use the Large Gear on it to lower some stairs that you can use to get to the upper level.
- [ ] IMPORTANT: take the Large Gear with you.
- [ ] Go round the bell cage and up the stairs.
- [ ] Look for another mechanism on the upper level.
- [ ] Examine it to receive a Small Gear and place your Large Gear in the mechanism.
- [ ] Run back down the stairs and look for another mechanism near the cage.
- [ ] Use your Small Gear to fire up the works.
- [ ] The bell will dislodge another orange box containing the second Electronic Part.
- [ ] If you want to, you can go out through the door to the west, follow the corridor around and pick up a Gunpowder (Large).
- [ ] This does take a little while, however.
- [ ] Leave the Clocktower the way you came in.
- [ ] Grab a Green Herb from just outside the door and run to the opposite corner, avoiding any zombies on your way, and unlock the door leading to the East Storeroom.
- [ ] Run straight through, down the stairs and into the Chief's Office where you're safe.
- [ ] Save your game.
- [ ] Go into the Private Collection Room and place the Electronic Parts in the device next to the locked door.
- [ ] You now have to manipulate elements to join up the input wires on the left to the output wire on the right.
- [ ] Each time you interact with a square you will rotate it though ninety degrees.
- [ ] Numbering the squares 1-16 left to right and top to bottom, here's a solution: 2, 5, 7, 7, 7, 8, 11, 12, 12, 14, 16.
- [ ] This will open the door to the barred off area.
- [ ] Pick up the Parking Garage Key Card for a cutscene.
- [ ] Afterwards, you will find yourself in control of Sherry.
- [ ] Turn around and pick up the Stuffed Doll.
- [ ] Examine it in your inventory to receive a Block.
- [ ] Take it over to the puzzle in the corner.
- [ ] This is random, but fixed for your game.
- [ ] Therefore, you can figure out which blocks go in which order, write it down and reload your game.
- [ ] This can save you a minute or so.
- [ ] You complete the puzzle when it looks like this: Pick up the scissors and use them on the cardboard covering the nearby wall.
- [ ] Squat and duck under to find yourself in a hallway.
- [ ] Head south and east.
- [ ] When you come to a dead end, pull out the second drawer up, climb up and go through the window.
- [ ] You'll be in the nursery.
- [ ] Run to the end, duck under the play arch and go though the door.
- [ ] Go downstairs.
- [ ] Don't bother trying the main door; instead, take the other exit.
- [ ] Run through the winding passage - you can save your game along the way if you like.
- [ ] Go past the body on the table and look for the key hanging from the wall.
- [ ] Try to grab it.
- [ ] Of course it's not going to be that easy.
- [ ] Run back through the passage and back upstairs.
- [ ] When you get to the nursery, duck under the play arch again and hide behind the furniture facing the door.
- [ ] When Irons arrives, you will have to edge around the furniture to avoid him.
- [ ] Shortly, he will stomp to the top of the room and kick aside some furniture.
- [ ] When he comes back down, you need to make your way up there and hide again.
- [ ] When you can, take the opportunity to find a hiding place on the left side of the big table.
- [ ] Eventually, Irons will go to the bathroom.
- [ ] Take this opportunity to grab the Orphanage Key.
- [ ] Now you have to run around the big table, duck through the play arch and use the key on the door to the nursery.
- [ ] Run downstairs and use the key on the front door.
- [ ] Unfortunately, it's chained shut.
- [ ] Run over to the other door and use the Orphanage Key to unlock it.
- [ ] Sherry will lock it behind herself but that will only buy you a moment.
- [ ] Run down the winding passage and go through the door at the end.
- [ ] Events will take a turn for the unexpected and control will switch back to Claire.
- [ ] When you get control, leave the Private Collection Room, run through the Chief's Office and back outside to the lift to the basement.
- [ ] Once inside, use the Key Card on the Card Reader.
- [ ] As the door rises, you know who will show up to interrupt you.
- [ ] Lead him a chase around the cars and head through the gate when it finally opens.
- [ ] Run across the street to where two zombies are pressing against the fence.
- [ ] When they break it down, one will fall over.
- [ ] You can either kite the zombies and Mr.
- [ ] X or, if you have a Flash Grenade, you can let the second zombie grab you and use the grenade on him.
- [ ] This should serve to stun Mr.
- [ ] X as well.
- [ ] Either way, you need to head down the alley.
- [ ] Climb up the stairs and follow the very long walkway.
- [ ] At the end, you will see steps leading down with a zombie at the bottom.
- [ ] Drop her and leap over the bin.
- [ ] Shoot the infected dog through the fence.
- [ ] Go though the gate and onto the street.
- [ ] The place will be swarming with dogs.
- [ ] Avoid them as best you can, but don't try to take them on.
- [ ] Head through a basketball court.
- [ ] You can find a Green Herb and Submachine Gun Ammo x 50 on a bench.
- [ ] You'll also see some dogs on the other side of the fence and should be able to manage to shoot one of them at least.
- [ ] Leave through the other gate.
- [ ] Avoid the dogs and make your way over to a bus.
- [ ] Grab the Blue Herb next to it and go inside.
- [ ] You're safe from the dogs in here (as far as I can tell) but there's a zombie at the back who will need to be taken out.
- [ ] Afterwards, pick up the Hand Grenade from the seat and leave through the rear exit.
- [ ] Your path to the Orphanage gate is now clear.
- [ ] Go though and Claire will bolt it behind her.
- [ ] And (Unclear in source) breathe out.
- [ ] Go though the main entrance and head upstairs to the nursery.
- [ ] Go into the bathroom and pick up the First Aid Spray and Submachine Gun Ammo x 50.
- [ ] Go back downstairs and go though the door to the Director's Room.
- [ ] Follow the passage round for a cutscene.
- [ ] Afterwards, follow the passageway until you come to a ladder leading down.
- [ ] Go down the ladder and go down the stairs into the cellar.
- [ ] When you find Sherry, Mr.
- [ ] X will have followed you down.
- [ ] Run along the linear path until you get to a lift.
- [ ] Go inside for the best scene in the game.
- [ ] After the intense scenes in the Orphanage, you will meet Annette Birkin, the third member of gaming's most dysfunctional family.
- [ ] After the scene, run to the barrels at the back of the room for Submachine Gun Ammo x 30 and then turn around and go through the door to the Safe Room.
- [ ] You will find High Powered Rounds (SLS 60) x 3 on the desk.
- [ ] Use the item box, save your game and return to the previous room.
- [ ] Drop down the hole in the floor.
- [ ] Follow the tunnel along and at drop down into the Lower Waterway.
- [ ] Wade west through the muck and pick up some High Grade Gunpowder along the way.
- [ ] When you are able to, get up onto dry land.
- [ ] Go up the stairs and through the door to find yourself in a room with a Cable Car.
- [ ] Go up more steps and climb the ladder to find yourself in the Control Room.
- [ ] There are three zombies in here who will need to be dealt with so that you can loot the locker.
- [ ] Enter SZF in the combination lock and grab the Submachine Gun Ammo x 100 inside.
- [ ] There's also a Flame Round in a corner.
- [ ] Drop down into the Monitor Room for a cutscene.
- [ ] Afterwards, grab the Large-Caliber Ammo x 4 from a small table, use the item box and save your game.
- [ ] You'll want six or seven free slots and may want to bring your SLS 60.
- [ ] As you leave the room, take the Sewers Map from the wall.
- [ ] Go through the door and pull the lever just ahead of you to activate a bridge.
- [ ] Go across and turn left at the end, heading north towards the cable car.
- [ ] Grab the Red Herb by the fence and the Tool from the table.
- [ ] Look on the table next to it for the final file Leon's Note (58/58).
- [ ] Reading this file will unlock the Lore Explorer trophy.
- [ ] One lousy Bronze for all that effort!
- [ ] Now backtrack past the door and turn right to find a safe.
- [ ] Use the combination L2, R12, L8 (ending on the 14) to open it and grab the Reinforced Frame (SLS-60) from inside.
- [ ] There's also a Blue Herb nearby, but you'll have to kill the zombie sitting on the ground to get it.
- [ ] Go back to the door marked "EXIT" and go through.
- [ ] At the bottom of the stairs are a pair of zombies that you will probably have to deal with permanently to get past.
- [ ] There's a third one here who is playing dead.
- [ ] Pick up the Green Herb, drop down into the muck and go right a short distance to find a Hand Grenade.
- [ ] Return to the platform, go through the tunnel and use your tool to turn the crank and open the door.
- [ ] Follow the walkway round and pick up the Sewer Key from the box on the wall.
- [ ] Drop back into the muck and arm yourself with your grenade launcher.
- [ ] There's a Green Herb next to a body.
- [ ] As you approach, a G-embryo will burst from the chest.
- [ ] Climb onto the platform just on to your left where there are a bunch of dead bodies with holes in their chests and go back down into the water.
- [ ] This next bit is hairy.
- [ ] There are three G-Adults in the water ahead.
- [ ] You'll be able to see the first a short distance ahead.
- [ ] Shoot it and run past when it rises out of the water.
- [ ] Quickly equip a Hand Grenade because the second one is hard to avoid.
- [ ] Use the grenade if it grabs you and run past it to the right (otherwise you'll reach a dead end).
- [ ] A third will emerge from a pipe near your goal along with a zombie but you should be able to wade past them get onto the platform.
- [ ] Go through the door and you'll be in the Supplies Storage Room.
- [ ] Head up the stairs and follow the walkway around.
- [ ] You'll find a Red Herb on a shelf but you should probably ignore it unless you have more than four free inventory slots.
- [ ] Go down the stairs, turn left and go through an open door way where you'll see the Queen Plug in its socket.
- [ ] Retrieve it and the gate will close, apparently locking you in.
- [ ] Go to the bottom of the passage that you're in and you can pick up a Blue Herb if you have space (combine it with the Red Herb for poison protection for the way back).
- [ ] There's a hard-to-see zombie lying on the ground here whom you can dispatch with your combat knife.
- [ ] You'll also find another Queen socket.
- [ ] Plug the Queen in and go through the door.
- [ ] As you go towards a flight of stairs, a zombie will fall down from above.
- [ ] Take it out so that we can explore freely.
- [ ] Go up the stairs and retrieve the King Plug from its socket at the top.
- [ ] The door will close and you'll have to drop down to the level below through a hole in the fence.
- [ ] Be careful when you do so because another zombie will have spawned nearby if you didn't deal with him earlier.
- [ ] Go through the door that you've just been though and go to the top of the passage.
- [ ] There is another King socket here.
- [ ] Use the King Plug and the gate will open allowing you to grab the Spark Shot.
- [ ] Before leaving this room, open the locked door.
- [ ] Go back the way you came and grab the King Plug.
- [ ] Retrieve the Queen Plug as well and put it back where you originally found it.
- [ ] Go though the opened gate and go west to find another King socket.
- [ ] Use the King Plug to open the gate and go though and retrieve the Queen Plug.
- [ ] Return to the King Plug and grab that as well.
- [ ] Leave the Storage Room and return to the sewer.
- [ ] You will likely have to deal with a zombie before you can drop down into the water.
- [ ] There'll be a G-Adult in front of you.
- [ ] Use your launcher and run around it to the left while it is panicked.
- [ ] Keep to the left of the area and climb up onto a platform and drop down the other side.
- [ ] There will be one more G-Adult in your way.
- [ ] Use your Grenade launcher again and then climb a ladder to where you found the Sewer Key.
- [ ] Go west and north around the walkway to where you fought the zombies earlier.
- [ ] There's a lever nearby that you need to pull to raise a grate.
- [ ] Drop back into the water and head east along the Lower Waterway.
- [ ] A G-Adult will emerge from a pipe but you should be able to avoid it.
- [ ] Climb onto the platform nearby, pick up the Blue Herb and use your Tool to raise the door.
- [ ] Go through and grab the High Powered Rounds x 4 from the barrel and take the Workroom Lift up.
- [ ] There's a zombie on the floor whom you will likely need to kill.
- [ ] There's a Hip Pouch on one table, the "Hiding Place" Roll Film on another and Large-Caliber Ammo x 5 on a lathe.
- [ ] Exit the room and deal with the swarm of zombies around the place.
- [ ] Go north past the Rook Plug and use the Sewer Key to open the door to the Water Injection Chamber.
- [ ] Inside you will find a Large Gunpowder and a High Grade Gunpowder.
- [ ] Leave the Water Injection Chamber and go back and retrieve the Rook Plug.
- [ ] South of here is another locked door that can be unlocked with the Sewer Key (you can discard it now).
- [ ] Grab the Gunpowder from the table and Large-Caliber Ammo x 5 from a locker.
- [ ] On the other side of the room are some taped-up lockers.
- [ ] Push them aside to reveal a lift.
- [ ] Go up and in the next room you find High Powered Rounds x 5 on a bucket.
- [ ] Go up the stairs and unlock the gate.
- [ ] This section is optional.
- [ ] Bring the Roll Film.
- [ ] Go up two flights of stairs to find the lift that takes you back up to the safe room under the Goddess Statue.
- [ ] Go up the stairs to the Main Hall.
- [ ] Go through the door to the West Office.
- [ ] There will likely be zombies in here that you will need to be careful to avoid.
- [ ] Go to the Dark Room and develop the Roll Film that you picked up earlier.
- [ ] This reveals the hiding places of two pieces of loot.
- [ ] Go up the stairs and go though the Shower Room to the S.T.A.R.S.
- [ ] Office.
- [ ] Examine the desk in the private office to find a Wooden Box containing a High-Capacity Mag (MQ 11) accessory which you can combine with your SMG.
- [ ] Make your way back downstairs and go across to the Press Room.
- [ ] Examine a desk in here for Needle Cartridge x 7 for your Spark Shot.
- [ ] Return to the space under the Goddess Statue.
- [ ] Go back down the lift and back down both flights of stairs.
- [ ] Take the stairs and lift back down to the Workers Break Room.
- [ ] Make your way back to the Workroom and take the lift back down.
- [ ] Drop back down into the water and go north up the Lower Waterway.
- [ ] There will be a G-Adult near to where you need to get out - use your grenade launcher if necessary.
- [ ] At the top get back on the platform and go up the stairs and through the door to emerge in the Cable Car room.
- [ ] Head up the stairs and ladder to the Control Room and drop down into the Monitor Room.
- [ ] Equip yourself for a boss fight from the item box.
- [ ] You want at least two full heals.
- [ ] Equip the MQ 11 and some spare ammo.
- [ ] I also equipped the SLS 60 with a clip of High Powered Rounds.
- [ ] Now to solve the door puzzle.
- [ ] Go into the back of the room and you'll see three sockets on either side.
- [ ] Face the notice board.
- [ ] The left hand side is Queen, Bishop, King.
- [ ] The right hand side is Knight, Rook, Pawn (the latter is already in the right place).
- [ ] With the plugs placed correctly, the nearby door will finally open.
- [ ] Go down the steps and grab the Blue Herb.
- [ ] Continue around the walkway, picking up a Green Herb along the way.
- [ ] Follow the walkway round the Main Power Room in the south.
- [ ] Take note of the corner in the screenshot below.
- [ ] Pick up the Red Herb and then flick the nearby power switches.
- [ ] The correct combination is 2, 3 and 4.
- [ ] Approach the door to see a massive claw come through the ceiling.
- [ ] Unlike the A scenario, there isn't a safe corner to hide in so just run around and hope that the RNG gods are your side.
- [ ] Eventually, G-2 Birkin will burst through the door.
- [ ] Avoid him and get out of the room - you can't beat him here.
- [ ] Run along the passage west to the Processed Water Purification Room.
- [ ] Jump down to the arena.
- [ ] There's a cargo container on a crane.
- [ ] Hit the left hand switch as soon as you can.
- [ ] Pick up a Flash Grenade and a Combat Knife while you're here.
- [ ] The goal is to get Birkin down on one knee in the path of the returning crane swing.
- [ ] When that happens, quickly hit the right hand switch on the crane controls.
- [ ] Hopefully, G-2 will stay down long enough for the container to hit him.
- [ ] As previously, the prominent shoulder eye is a weakpoint and another eye has grown out of his back.
- [ ] You need to hit him with the container twice or bring him down to one knee three times and hit him with the container once.
- [ ] If you need it, the arena also has Large-Caliber Ammo x 8 to pick up along with Submachine Gun Ammo x 80.
- [ ] After the fight, a new path will have opened up that takes you to the Garbage Room.
- [ ] Flick the switch on the door for a cutscene.
- [ ] Afterwards, you'll need to carry Sherry to the cable car.
- [ ] Leave the Garbage Room, turn right and go up the stairs to the Monitor Room.
- [ ] Leave through the other door and go across the bridge in the Treatment Pool Room.
- [ ] Turn left at the end and make your way to the Cable Car.
- [ ] Go inside and flick the switch on the front console for another cutscene.
- [ ] When the cable car comes to a halt, carry Sherry down the stairs.
- [ ] Her ID Wristband will open the triple set of doors at the bottom.
- [ ] Welcome to NEST.
- [ ] Go south and through the door on your left to the Security Room for a scene.
- [ ] Pick up the Flame Round from the centre table and go around it to pick up the Research Lab North Area Map.
- [ ] Leave the room and, if you like, save your game - there's a typewriter in the break room just behind the reception desk.
- [ ] If you use the item box, make sure you have Flame Rounds for your launcher.
- [ ] You may want to keep your SLS 60 with a magnum round in it for one particular enemy.
- [ ] Go through the door leading west and follow it round to the Canteen.
- [ ] There are several members of the walking dead in here.
- [ ] One is wandering around and can be seen from the doorway.
- [ ] Drop him and then look in the right hand corner for two corpses on the floor.
- [ ] Pick up the Hand Grenade nearby; the one on the right will come to life and you may have to put her down.
- [ ] Look on the tables in the middle of the room for Large-Caliber Ammo x 8.
- [ ] A third zombie is on the floor on the left side of the room, feeding.
- [ ] Pick up the Needle Cartridges x 4 from the counter and leave her to her dinner.
- [ ] Follow the clear area round to the back.
- [ ] Another zombie will get up but you should be able to avoid him by climbing the ladder.
- [ ] Follow the passage in the roofspace and drop down into the kitchen.
- [ ] Pick up the Large Gunpowder and Combat Knife from the counter and arm yourself with your magnum.
- [ ] Open the door very carefully because the worst zombie in the game is just outside - he's in full body armour and will chew you up good as you exit.
- [ ] Instead, remain in the doorway and let him come to you.
- [ ] Backpedal a little and blow his head off when he gets near.
- [ ] Go west to the Nap Room at the end.
- [ ] Pick up the Flame Round from the table.
- [ ] Look in the left hand locker for a High Voltage Condenser (Spark Shot) attachment which you should immediately combine with your Spark Shot if you have it.
- [ ] Finally, look at the arm dangling out of the bunk.
- [ ] Grab the Electronic Chip off it and combine it with your ID Wristband to get level 2 clearance.
- [ ] Take the direct route back to the reception area and use the item box to clear a few spaces in your inventory.
- [ ] Go through the door to the south that is now passable with your level 2 clearance.
- [ ] Examine the dead soldier on the ground for the Special Forces Recording and flick through the info screens to update your goals.
- [ ] Look to his left to find the Signal Modulator.
- [ ] Examine the Signal Modulator, set it to "OSS" and twiddle the knobs until the waveforms look like this: Return to the Nap Room and plug the Signal Modulator into the wall.
- [ ] Retrieve the final Hip Pouch from the bunk and hightail it out of there.
- [ ] Return to the place where you found the Modulator and use the console to extend a bridge to the central area.
- [ ] Go across and find the level 2 console that extends a bridge to the East Lab Area.
- [ ] Go across this new bridge to find yourself in the East Lab lobby.
- [ ] Pick up the Green Herb from the counter and some Gunpowder from the desk and save your game.
- [ ] Arm yourself with your pistol and go though the eastern door to the Presentation Room.
- [ ] You will see a dead scientist with a level 3 clearance wristband pinned to the window by excessive plant growth.
- [ ] Leave via the northwest entrance and look up to see an Ivy dangling from the ceiling.
- [ ] Shoot the sacs on its body to make it collapse and then use a Flame Round to burn it up.
- [ ] Pick up the High Grade Gunpowder from a console table and kill another Ivy a short distance ahead.
- [ ] Make your way past its smouldering remains and continue into the Control Room.
- [ ] Pick up the Flash Grenade from the table and examine the console to your right.
- [ ] You enter access codes using strange symbols.
- [ ] You're supposed to figure these out as you explore the labs.
- [ ] Don't worry about the symbols - just treat it as a normal numeric keypad.
- [ ] Enter 5831 to unlock a hatch in the Greenhouse and 2048 to enable you to use the mixing machine in the Drug Testing Lab.
- [ ] Examine the machine near the window to receive an empty Dispersal Cartridge.
- [ ] Enter the Greenhouse and turn left.
- [ ] Pick up the Red Herb from the walkway and continue into the Drug Testing Lab.
- [ ] Grab the Large Gunpowder from the middle table and a Hand Grenade from the floor by a dead scientist in a corner.
- [ ] Use your Dispersal Cartridge on the machine in the other corner.
- [ ] There are three colour-coded buttons.
- [ ] Your goal is to get the exact right amount of solution in the leftmost vial.
- [ ] Here's a solution: B, R, G, B, R, G, B, R.
- [ ] G.
- [ ] This will fill your dispenser up.
- [ ] Not quite there yet, however.
- [ ] Head back out to the Greenhouse.
- [ ] Your goal is the hatch in the southeast corner of the Greenhouse but depending on the enemy placement, you may have to take a slightly roundabout route.
- [ ] If so, you can pick up a Blue Herb on the way.
- [ ] Go down the ladder.
- [ ] At the bottom go into the western corner to find a Large Gunpowder and the Research Lab Area East Map.
- [ ] Now go through the door in the opposite corner.
- [ ] Ignore the corridor to your left and continue into a Lounge area.
- [ ] Pick up the Flame Rounds x 3 from the arm of the sofa and check out the corpses in the room.
- [ ] The three on the left are playing-dead zombies and will screw you over shortly so take a few moments to kill them.
- [ ] There's a Green Herb lying around that you may want to pick up.
- [ ] Examine your Signal Modulator and set it to "URF".
- [ ] Twiddle the knobs until the waveforms look like this: Use the Modulator on the socket in the wall near the vending machines to restore power to the area.
- [ ] Now that the power's back on we can access the Server Room.
- [ ] There are a bunch of goodies to pick up - High Grade Gunpowder, a Combat Knife and Flame Rounds x 3.
- [ ] More importantly, it's a Safe Room so you can manage your inventory and save your game.
- [ ] Return to the Lounge and run west.
- [ ] As you approach the Low Temperature Lab, two Lickers will drop down from the ceiling.
- [ ] Run through the door and you should escape being clawed.
- [ ] Ignore the Trophy that is in plain sight and ignore the corpse on the ground - she won't bother you if you don't bother her.
- [ ] Place your dispenser in the cryogenic machine to create Herbicide.
- [ ] Leave the lab and return to the lounge area.
- [ ] The Lickers will be patrolling the open area so continue west through two doors.
- [ ] There'll be a zombie at the foot of the stairs whom you will need to take care of.
- [ ] Run up the stairs avoiding the Ivy and a zombie that drops down behind you.
- [ ] In the room at the top is another zombie whom you will need to drop.
- [ ] Afterwards, you can loot Large-Caliber Ammo x 8 from a locker and High Grade Gunpowder from a pile of boxes.
- [ ] Open the door back to the Lobby, dump stuff in the item box and save your game.
- [ ] Make your way back through the Presentation Room to the Control Room.
- [ ] Use the vial of Herbicide in the Dispenser Machine to destroy some of the growth in the Greenhouse allowing you access to the dead scientist with the level 3 wristband.
- [ ] Arm yourself with your grenade launcher and a Combat Knife.
- [ ] On your way to pick up the wristband, it is important that you clear a path back to the Control Room.
- [ ] You don't need to kill the Ivies just get them on their backs kicking and screaming; when they get up again, you'll be long gone.
- [ ] Pick up the wristband and increase your clearance to level 3.
- [ ] Fight your way back to the control room.
- [ ] Beware that there is an Ivy just inside.
- [ ] Head back to the lobby and save your game.
- [ ] Return to the central shaft and use your level 3 clearance to open up a path to the Lab Area West.
- [ ] Go across and though the door.
- [ ] Pick up the Hand Grenade from the floor next to the dead soldier and continue to the next room.
- [ ] Examine the Signal Modulator, set it to "AWS" and twiddle the knobs until the waveforms look like this: Plug it into the wall and the power will turn on in the lab.
- [ ] You can now discard the Signal Modulator.
- [ ] Head west, picking up a Blue Herb and High Grade Gunpowder as you go.
- [ ] Cross the long bridge in the Bioreactors Room and continue through the decontamination area.
- [ ] When you get to the end examine sealed container on your left and cancel out for a cutscene where you'll remember about Sherry's locket and use it to unlock the container and obtain the antiviral agent you need.
- [ ] Just across the way is a Safe Room with some goodies: Large Gunpowder, High Grade Gunpowder and a Red Herb.
- [ ] Prepare yourself for a major boss fight.
- [ ] Bring lots of SMG ammo and stick High Powered Rounds in your SLS 60.
- [ ] Be careful not to use up all your ammo in the upcoming fight because this isn't the final (or even penultimate) boss!
- [ ] You want at least three full heals (you should have a decent amount of G+R+B herbs at this point).
- [ ] Don't bring knives - the boss doesn't appear to grab you - but Hand Grenades are always good if you can spare them.
- [ ] Save your game.
- [ ] Head back through the Bioreactors Room for a massive cutscene after which you're thrown into battle with Birkin in his G-3 form.
- [ ] You goal is to destroy the eyes on his body then target the eye complex that appears in his chest.
- [ ] Try and be on the move at all times and make sure that you target the eyes because shooting the rest of him doesn't do too much good.
- [ ] Use your SMG to destroy the eyes on his front and back.
- [ ] When, you've destroyed these, an bulbous eye will reveal itself in the centre of his abdomen.
- [ ] Use your high powered rounds against it.
- [ ] After a while, the original eyes will grow back again so switch back to your SMG and repeat.
- [ ] You can also douse him with acid and use the Spark Shot against him when he kneels.
- [ ] During and after the fight, be sure to pick up the goodies dotted around (Large-Caliber Ammo x 48, HighPowered Rounds x 4, Needle Cartridge x 3, a Hand Grenade, 2 Flash Grenades and a First Aid Spray).
- [ ] When you're done looting, take the lift up.
- [ ] Run back out of the West Lab Area (you might want to use the item box on the way).
- [ ] Return to the North Area and go into the Security Room where you left Sherry for a cutscene.
- [ ] Afterwards, Annette will give you her level 4 clearance and you will hear an announcement which doesn't sound very promising.
- [ ] Better get out of there.
- [ ] Head back to the central shaft and take the lift down.
- [ ] At the bottom, pick up the First Aid Spray.
- [ ] If you're injured, you may as well use it.
- [ ] Go through the door and down the stairs.
- [ ] You can save your game and use the item box if you like.
- [ ] Go through the next door and take the lift down.
- [ ] A countdown will now commence.
- [ ] You have ten minutes to get out.
- [ ] You can pick up a Blue Herb if you like.
- [ ] Arm yourself with your grenade launcher.
- [ ] Go through the next door to find Ivies blocking your path.
- [ ] Use Flame Rounds to deal with them.
- [ ] Go through the next door, pick up a Green Herb and take the ladder down.
- [ ] The next door is locked.
- [ ] But fortunately you have Sherry to climb around really slowly while Ivies harass you.
- [ ] After you've taken down two or three, the door will open and you can go though.
- [ ] Follow the path around and deal with a burning zombie in your way.
- [ ] Continue until you come to a room with a train on a turntable.
- [ ] There's an item box in here so prepare.
- [ ] You'll need to leave two slots free so ditch your Grenade Launcher.
- [ ] Otherwise, bring any grenades and full healing items that you have.
- [ ] Go round to the other side of the train.
- [ ] Go inside and pick up the Joint Plug for a scene.
- [ ] Go back outside and through the southern door to the control room.
- [ ] Use the Joint Plug on the central console for a cutscene.
- [ ] Afterwards, pick up the Minigun that someone left just lying around and leave.
- [ ] Head towards the train and you'll be rudely interrupted by Birkin in his G-4 form.
- [ ] There's no real secret to this just let him have it with your Minigun and with Hand Grenades.
- [ ] Important: leave around 75 rounds or so in the Mingun.
- [ ] Kite him around the train to avoid damage.
- [ ] I had to switch to the SMG right at the end.
- [ ] When he crawls he's almost done for so use anything you have remaining.
- [ ] When he's done, you'll be able to move the train and Leon will join you in a warming cutscene.
- [ ] Unfortunately, we're not done yet.
- [ ] You will go to investigate what the source of the sound was.
- [ ] Save your game if you like.
- [ ] Use the item box.
- [ ] If you're short on ammo, pick the Quickdraw Army along with any Large-Caliber Ammo that you may have.
- [ ] Just in case you need it after the previous two boss fights.
- [ ] And make sure you've still got the Minigun.
- [ ] Go through the rear carriages until you come across the final, final boss, Birkin in his G-5 form.
- [ ] There's a secret to this boss: the more he advances, the more damage your attacks do.
- [ ] Open up with your SMG (or whatever you have - even the Quickdraw Army will do).
- [ ] When Claire can't go back any further, bring out the Minigun and send every remaining round into the big central eye.
- [ ] Enjoy the final, final cutscenes.
