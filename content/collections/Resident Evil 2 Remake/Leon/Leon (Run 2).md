# Leon B (2nd Run)

## Get to the RPD (Leon - 2nd Run)

- [ ] Choose "New Game [2nd Run]" / "Leon S. Kennedy" from the main menu along with your preferred difficulty.

### The Graveyard

- [ ] After the cutscenes you will find yourself in a graveyard.
- [ ] You have your Matilda pistol and five rounds.
- [ ] Continue through the passage past the chained-up door on your right and go up the stairs on the other side.
- [ ] Pick up the Red Herb at the top of the stairs and the Blue Herb slightly further ahead on the right.
  - [ ] Just before the opening in the wall, look left to find the final Mr. Raccoon figure (15/15).
- [ ] Destroying the last Mr. Raccoon figurine will unlock the Complete Vermin Extermination trophy.
  - [ ] If you reload your game, the Infinite Combat Knife will become available when you access the item box.
- [ ] During the B scenarios, you are generally short of ammo (unless you managed to get an S-rank) which makes this bonus weapon invaluable for killing downed zombies.
- [ ] You may only have four or five bullets but that doesn't mean you can't make them count.
- [ ] Look for the fat police officer near the stairs.
- [ ] Three bullets to the knee should take the leg off.
- [ ] There's a female corpse just through the opening - put the other bullet or bullets in her knee.
- [ ] Continue around the corner and look for a wheelbarrow containing the Cutting Tool.
- [ ] Pick it up for a familiar cutscene.
  - [ ] Afterwards, the bodies lying round will start getting up.
- [ ] Despite this, you should have no problem making your way back to the door you ignored earlier.
- [ ] Use the Cutting Tool on the chain and go inside.
- [ ] Grab the Courtyard Key from the locker and you'll also pick up your uniform.
- [ ] There's Large-Caliber Handgun Ammo to your right.
- [ ] Look on the desk for the M19 Pistol and don't miss the Hand Grenade on the radiator.
- [ ] Use the item box.
- [ ] Matilda is kinda useless - additional ammunition can only be made - so put it away.
- [ ] Leave when you're ready.
- [ ] You need to return to where you picked up the Cutting Tool.
- [ ] Knobbling a couple of the undead earlier should make your path a little smoother.
  - [ ] However, at least three zombies will block your way near the opening.
- [ ] I would be inclined to throw your grenade here.
  - [ ] Otherwise, you'll be chewed severely.
  - [ ] Return to the gate and use the Courtyard Key which you can now discard.
  - [ ] Once through the gate, pick up the Large-Caliber Ammo and some Wooden Boards and go through the door.
  - [ ] If you're injured, there's a First Aid Spray in the nearby Bathroom.
- [ ] Go into the Watchman's Room.
- [ ] The upper half of Eliot is crawling around and he'll chew your leg given half a chance.
- [ ] Since you'll need to come though a few times, take the time to put him down.
- [ ] Pick up the file Scrap of Paper (53/55) from the desk.
- [ ] Leave through the north.
- [ ] There's a Combat Knife sticking out of the wall so help yourself.
- [ ] Make your way north to the Break Room.
- [ ] Pick up the Shotgun Shells x 2 from the shelf nearby and go inside.
- [ ] You may need to unload stuff into the item box to get everything from here.
- [ ] There's a Blue Herb on the desk, Large-Caliber Ammo x 8 in a locker and High Grade Gunpowder in the locker next to it.
- [ ] The room to the rear has MAG Ammo x 3 on the sink and an Electrical Part on the chair.
- [ ] Use the item box again and save your game.
- [ ] Head back through the Watchman's Room and use the Cutting Tool on the door to the East Office.
  - [ ] Before opening the door, go round the corner to the right since there's a zombie there that will attack you shortly.
- [ ] Inside the East Office is another zombie and you'll want to take him down too.
- [ ] I'd be inclined to allow the zombie at the window to break in and take him out as well.
  - [ ] Then begin looting.
- [ ] There's a Green Herb near the door and a Flash Grenade nearby.
- [ ] You can find Large-Caliber Ammo x 5 on the corpse near the window.
- [ ] The large desk has some Gunpowder.
- [ ] Inside the private office area is High Grade Gunpowder and the Round Handle.
- [ ] Unblock the door leading west and go out into the hall.
- [ ] Use the Electrical Part on the nearby fuse box.
  - [ ] This not only raises the shutter but handily frees up a slot in your inventory.
- [ ] Go north to the cupboard to pick up some more Wooden Boards and there's also Large-Caliber Ammo x 5.

## Police Station

- [ ] Head back south and go into the Main Hall.
- [ ] Be careful because there's a zombie just inside.
- [ ] On the desk is a Hip Pouch and Large-Caliber Ammo x 3.
- [ ] Pick up the can of First Aid Spray from the boxes nearby if you have room.
- [ ] Go behind the desk to find Marvin shuffling around and put an end to his misery.
- [ ] Look on the couch nearby for the file Notebook with Missing Page (54/58) which gives you the solutions to the Goddess Statue puzzle.
- [ ] Except for the Lion Statue which is illegible.
- [ ] Go west into Reception.
- [ ] There's a Green Herb here and Large-Caliber Ammo x 6.
  - [ ] When you get to the corridor outside, walk.
- [ ] Very.
- [ ] Slowly.
- [ ] There's a Licker here.
- [ ] Theparert naerers a. lPsroi vaa cnyu mPobleicr yof unboarded windows - you may remember how hellishA cthciesp cto Crroidookri ecsould become in scenario A.
  - [ ] You should have two Wooden Boards so you can board up two windows as you creep north.
- [ ] Go round the corner and enter the Operations Room.
- [ ] Grab the Police Station 1F Map off the board.
- [ ] You can cut the chain on the southern door here and discard the Cutting Tool.
- [ ] Inside, pick up the Wooden Boards and go back into the western corridor and board up another window.
  - [ ] Return and look on the table for the Electronic Gadget.
- [ ] There's also a Green Herb in here if you want it along with a Flash Grenade.
- [ ] Unlock the door to the corridor outside and take care of the fat zombie banging on the vending machine.
- [ ] Ignore the Safety Deposit Room for the time being and make your way north towards the stairs and the Dark Room.
- [ ] A zombie will come through the window as you approach so take him down.
- [ ] Go into the Dark Room and dump stuff - store the Electronic Gadget for the time being along with your Flash Grenades.
- [ ] You want to have six free slots and a single Blue Herb in your inventory (trust me).
- [ ] There is Gunpowder and Large-Calibre Ammo x 2 in the lockers and a Red Herb in the back room that you can put in the item box.
- [ ] Save your game.
- [ ] There are two zombies outside.
- [ ] Put them down because you'll be coming here a lot.
- [ ] Go upstairs to the first floor.
- [ ] You can pick up Large-Caliber Ammo x 3 from the corner.
- [ ] Go past the door to find a Red Herb and then go into the shower room.
  - [ ] As you go in look to your right to find a Box.
- [ ] The lockers in here contain Shotgun Shells x 6 (one requires the combination "CAP"), but I'd leave them where they are for the time being because of limited inventory space.
- [ ] Use your Round Handle on the shower vent to shut off steam.
- [ ] Go back out and go upstairs to the third floor and put down the zombie here.
- [ ] The locker uses the combination "DCM" and contains MAG Ammo x 5.
- [ ] Again, leave it where it is.
- [ ] Instead, go into the office and grab up the Spade Key from the desk.
- [ ] Leave though the door and follow the corridor around to the West Storage Room.
- [ ] Pick up the Wooden Boards and go through to the Library.
- [ ] Go across the wooden bridge and down the stairs.
- [ ] There's a zombie at the bottom whom you should kill.
- [ ] Take a moment or two to kill the fat zombie sitting near the Spade Door.
- [ ] There is a Combat Knife on the floor by one of the dead cops near the Lounge door.
- [ ] For the moment, just make a note of it.
  - [ ] Afterwards, go into the Lounge.
- [ ] Pick up the Police Station Upper Floors Map from the notice board and examine the Unicorn Statue.
- [ ] Turn the dials to read Twins, Scales, Worm to receive the Unicorn Medallion.
- [ ] Pick up the Box from the table.
- [ ] Examine it to obtain the "Lion Statue" Roll Film.
  - [ ] Return to the library and go to where the moveable bookshelves are.
- [ ] There's a zombie feeding whom you should kill.
- [ ] Look at the rightmost bookcase and move it one to the left.
- [ ] Move the leftmost two one space to the right.
  - [ ] This will save time later.
- [ ] You can find Large Caliber Ammo x 6 behind the leftmost shelf when you're done.
- [ ] Pick up the Red Book near the Spade Door, unlock it and go through.
- [ ] Turn right and go to the end of the landing and pick up the Large Caliber Ammo x 8.
- [ ] Make your way downstairs and place the Unicorn Medallion in the Goddess Statue to free up an inventory slot.
- [ ] Use the Spade Key to unlock the door to the West Office.
- [ ] There is a zombie inside the private office area who will need to be taken out.
  - [ ] Afterwards, open the safe.
- [ ] The combination is L9, R15, L7 - you should end up on the 1.
- [ ] Grab the Hip Pouch to give yourself two more item slots.
- [ ] On your way back to the door, grab Large-Caliber Ammo x2 from a locker in the corner if you want it along with the Gunpowder on the table.
- [ ] You can ignore the puzzle desk since it contains an upgrade for Matilda.
  - [ ] If you choose to pick it up anyway, the combinations are "NED" and "MRG".
- [ ] Leave through the door to the north and make your way back to the Dark Room.
- [ ] Use the item box to stash stuff you don't need.
- [ ] Develop the film that you picked up in the Lounge to reveal the solution for the Lion Statue.
  - [ ] Return to the Main Hall, go upstairs and make your way around the landing to the Waiting Room.
- [ ] Pick up the Green Herb but ignore the safe - it contains a weapon upgrade we don't need.
  - [ ] If you really want it, the combination is L6, R2, L11 (you should end up on the 15) which gives you the Muzzle Brake attachment for your Matilda pistol.
- [ ] Unlock the Spade Door, discard the key and go though.
- [ ] Be careful because there are two zombies in this hallway.
  - [ ] After you've taken care of them, grab the Wooden Boards at the end of the corridor.
- [ ] Go into the Art Room and grab the Weapons Locker Key Card from the table.
- [ ] Go over to the other table and use the Red Book with the Statue Arm.
- [ ] Picyko uurp u tshee oAf romu rW siitteh wBitoho oku ar nsdo cuiasle m ite odina ,t haed vsetratitsuieng t oa nredc aenivaely taic sScepter.
  - [ ] This will cause a Licker to spawn into If you can get out unscratched, more power to you.
- [ ] But get out of there.
  - [ ] Once safe, examine the Scepter to receive the Red Jewel.
- [ ] Combine it with the Box in your inventory to receive the S.T.A.R.S. Badge.
- [ ] Go back through the Waiting Room.
- [ ] Pick up the Green Herb if you haven't done already, go to the landing and examine the Lion Statue.
- [ ] Turn the dials to read Crown, Fire, Dove to receive the Lion Medallion.
- [ ] Go down the stairs and place the Lion Medallion in the Goddess Statue.
- [ ] Two down.
- [ ] Go through the West Office to the Safety Deposit Room and use the Weapons Locker Key Card on the locker at the back and grab the W-870 Shotgun and the Shotgun Shells x 4 inside.
  - [ ] If you enter 109 on the keypad, you can also grab Large Caliber Ammo x 5 from one of the lockers.
- [ ] Take a moment to switch weapons and load ammo into your shotgun.
  - [ ] Return to the Dark Room to dump any stuff that you don't need.
- [ ] Leave healing items behind (trust me).
- [ ] Keep the S.T.A.R.S. Badge and pick up the Electronic Gadget along with your Shotgun Shells and any Flash Grenades you may have.
- [ ] Save your game.
- [ ] Go upstairs to the first floor.
- [ ] Grab the two lots of Shotgun Shells from the lockers that you ignored earlier and go through the shower room.
- [ ] There's some Gunpowder in a locker which you may want to pick up.
- [ ] Head though the door to the corridor beyond.
- [ ] Go into the S.T.A.R.S. Office and loot.
- [ ] There's a Red Herb just inside the door.
- [ ] Go inside the room to find some High Grade Gunpowder on a desk.
- [ ] Look in the nearby pouch hanging from the wall to find a First Aid Spray.
- [ ] There's Shotgun Shells x 2 on another desk and Large-Caliber Hand Ammo x 6 on a trolley at the back of the room.
  - [ ] You'll also find a file Claire's Memo (55/58).
- [ ] Examine the S.T.A.R.S. Badge in your inventory to reveal a USB connector.
- [ ] Place it in the tower PC on the desk and then use the keyboard next to it to open the Armory where you'll find the Lightning Eagle.
- [ ] Remember to pick up your Badge from the PC.
- [ ] Go into the private office area and get the Battery from the desk.
- [ ] Combine it with the Electronic Gadget to create a Detonator.

### Safe Rooms and Mr. X

- [ ] Now leave the office and head back through the showers (do not go south or you'll Druon N sotrta Sigehllt Minyto Mr. X).
- [ ] Go upstairs and pick up the MAG Ammo from the locker.
- [ ] You may hear some familiar footsteps behind you - don't panic.
- [ ] Go into the Western Storage Room, use the Detonator on the C4 and retreat to the library until you hear the explosion.
- [ ] Go back into the Western Storeroom and examine the Maiden Statue.
- [ ] Turn the dials to read Ram, Harp, Bird to receive the Maiden Medallion.
- [ ] While you were solving the puzzle, Mr. X may well have entered the Western Storeroom to try and stop you.
  - [ ] If so, throw a Flash Grenade at his feet and run into the library.
- [ ] The quickest way down is to go left and down the ladder.
- [ ] Run through the Spade Door to the Main Hall landing, run downstairs and place the final medallion in the Goddess Statue.
- [ ] Go to the safe room underneath, pick up the Shotgun Shells x 3 and Gunpowder that you can find on the desks, use the item box and save your game.
- [ ] Keep the S.T.A.R.S. Badge and the Lightning Hawk.
- [ ] Make your way to the exit and take the lift down.
- [ ] Using the lift despawns Mr. X from the police station.
  - [ ] If there's stuff you want to do up there, you can do so in relative safety.
- [ ] One suggestion is to open the door connecting the S.T.A.R.S. office corridor to the Lounge.
- [ ] Go down two flights of stairs to an old storeroom.
- [ ] Pick up the Hand Grenade from the floor and check out the locked cabinet.
- [ ] Examine your S.T.A.R.S. Badge and retract the USB connector if you've not done so already.
- [ ] Use the badge on the cabinet to unlock it and retrieve the Long Barrel (Lightning Hawk) accessory that you can combine with your Lightning Hawk right away.
- [ ] Go back upstairs to the first landing and go through the open door.
- [ ] Follow the path round until your way is blocked by a fallen filing cabinet.

### Birkin (G-1)

- [ ] Move it out of the way to trigger a cutscene and your first boss encounter with William Birkin in his G-1 form.
- [ ] At the start of the fight you can get some sneaky slashes in with your combat knife.
  - [ ] Afterwards keep your distance and shoot him when you're not in danger, preferably in the head.
  - [ ] When the large eyeball appears from his shoulder, shoot that.
- [ ] Since this is the B scenario, your upgraded Lightning Hawk is very effective against him.
  - [ ] If he grabs you, you will stab him in the eyeball with your Combat Knife.
  - [ ] If he grabs you when you don't have any secondary weapons, he'll probably take you down into the red zone - use a healing item ASAP.
- [ ] Kite him around the walkways but use your map to ensure that you don't end up in a corner room when he's nearby - he'll trap you and you'll take a beating.
  - [ ] Afterwards, you'll probably be low on resources.
- [ ] Start with the bottom right corner room and grab Large-Caliber Ammo x 8 and a Green Herb.
- [ ] Move onto the lower left and help yourself to the Red Herb and Large-Caliber Ammo x 7.
  - [ ] Finally, go the upper right room and retrieve the Large-Caliber Ammo x 7, Hand Grenade and Green Herb.
  - [ ] When you're done looting, climb up the ladder in the north of the area to get back onto the walkways.
  - [ ] You'll find any Combat Knives that you used at the foot of the ladder.
- [ ] Go into the room on your right.
- [ ] Grab the Gunpowder from the lockers and a Green Herb.
- [ ] Run west and up the stairs.
  - [ ] As you go through the next room, pull a lever to activate a bridge.
- [ ] Go across and follow the walkway to the Operators Room.
- [ ] Grab the Hip Pouch from the locker, use the item box (I kept a G+R Herb) and save your game.
- [ ] Leave this room via the ladder leading up.
  - [ ] After a brief cutscene you will be in thPee rPsaornkainl gIn Gfoarrmagaeti.o Rnun over to the grille blocking the exit, investigate the card reader and cancel out for a cutscene where you're reintroduced to Ada Wong.
- [ ] And zombie dogs.
- [ ] Follow Ada through the southern door.
  - [ ] You'll find the Police Station B1 Map in a box on the wall and Large- Caliber Ammo x 4 on a cabinet.
- [ ] Hepaadr ttnherorsu.gPhr itvhaec ey xPito olifc tyhis room to enter the jail area.
- [ ] Ignore the undead in theA vcacrieoputs C coeollksi easnd make your way to the end to meet up with Ben Bertolucci who offers you his garage access card in return for freedom.
- [ ] Until events intervene, that is.
  - [ ] After the scene finishes, pick up the Tool from the table near Ben's cell and head back out to the garage.
  - [ ] This time, go through the northeastern exit.
- [ ] Take the passage leading south as you enter.
- [ ] Follow this passage until you arrive at the Kennel.
- [ ] There's a Blue Herb next to the door.
- [ ] Go inside and pick up the High Grade Gunpowder near the door and then examine the nearby cages.
  - [ ] You will see that there are three zombie dogs currently locked up.
- [ ] Take a moment or two to shoot them through the bars.
- [ ] Run around the cage area to the other exit in the east.
  - [ ] Back out in the corridor, go through the nearby door to the morgue.
- [ ] There's a zombie near the door pretending to be dead; he'll come to life shortly so you may want to kneecap him now.
  - [ ] If you pull out the last drawer on the right, you will find a Flash Grenade.
- [ ] Make sure you shut the drawer afterwards.
  - [ ] Finally, check out the second from last drawer on the other side.
- [ ] Pull out the drawer and grab the Diamond Key.
- [ ] The corpse next to it will come to life.
- [ ] Don't bother attempting to kill it, just hightail out of here.
- [ ] Go north from the Morgue until you come to a shutter blocking your way.
- [ ] Use the Tool that you picked up in the cells on the mechanism to raise it.
- [ ] Go past the shutter and enter the Generator Room on your right.
  - [ ] As you enter, look to the left for a Green Herb.
- [ ] Go back into the main area and look for a table with an orange box on it.
- [ ] Takpea rtthnee rBs.oPxeridv aEclye cPtroolinciyc Part and examine it in your inventory to reveal an ElecAtrcocneicp tP Caorto, koinees of two you need to get Ben's cell open.
- [ ] Opposite the table are some shelves with some Gunpowder.
- [ ] Run around the central structure to find a fuse box with four switches.
- [ ] Flick switches 2 and 3 to turn on the power.
  - [ ] This has the unfortunate side effect of unleashing a bunch of dogs into the underground area.
- [ ] Simply run out of the Generator Room - you can avoid most of the dogs just by running.
- [ ] The zombie from the morgue may have followed you in - use a Flash Grenade or suck up him chewing on you if needs be.
- [ ] Run through the Kennel and north up the corridor.
  - [ ] This bit is optional.
- [ ] Since it leads to an accessory for Matilda, I'd skip it.
- [ ] Turn east at the top and duck into the Firing Range.
- [ ] Ignore the zombies - they're no threat to you.
- [ ] Instead, pick up the yellow box and examine it for the Well Worn Key.
- [ ] Use the Diamond Key to open the door at the back (this is so that you can discard it later).
- [ ] You can pick up a Red Herb while you're at it, but leave the roll film behind.

## Basement & Parking Garage

### Parking Garage

- [ ] Heal up if needs be and go out into the Parking Garage.
- [ ] There are four infected dogs in here whom you may want to deal with now rather than later.
  - [ ] If you have the Well Worn Key in your inventory, examine it and turn it round to reveal a button.
- [ ] Press it to unlock the boot of the black and white police cruiser.
- [ ] Discard the key.
- [ ] Inside the boot is the Gun Stock for Matilda accessory.
  - [ ] This allows Matilda to burst fire and reduces the time it takes for your aiming reticule to shrink, but your gun now occupies two spaces in your inventory.
- [ ] Go back into the underground area.
- [ ] Go east past the door to the Firing Range, north up the passage and go through the door that you unlocked by tripping the switches in the Generator Room.
  - [ ] This will bring you up by the Break Room where you can use the item box and save your game.
- [ ] Bring some Wooden Boards with you.
- [ ] Leave the room and place Wooden Boards across the third and fourth windows along (if you can).
- [ ] Go south and around the corner to find three zombies.
- [ ] Two are immediate threats while the third is feeding on the lower half of Elliot.
- [ ] Go through the Watchman's Room and go outside, up the fire escape and back into the Police Station on 2F.
- [ ] Go west and north past the doors to the Waiting Room and Art Room.
- [ ] North of the Art Room is another shutter that you can open with your Tool, which you can then discard.
- [ ] In the new hallway, go up the stairs.
- [ ] At the top are some more Wooden Boards.
- [ ] The lockers contain a Flash Grenade and Large-Caliber Ammo x 8.
- [ ] Go through the door to the west which leads to the East Storage Room.
- [ ] Pick up the Blue Herb from the shelves and then look a little further inside for the Large Gear lying on top of a box.
  - [ ] If you deal with the enemies in here, you can pick up Shotgun Shells x 4 from a shelf near the Heart Door.
- [ ] Leave the room by the door that you came in through and then take the other door leading to the balcony.
- [ ] Pick up another Blue Herb from the table outside and then climb down the ladder for a cutscene.
- [ ] Go through the nearby door and pick up the Red Herb that's just inside then go back outside and down the stairs.
- [ ] At the bottom, go east to find two Green Herbs and then go west to the Boiler Room.
- [ ] Careful as you approach, because there's a couple of zombies just inside.
- [ ] Your best bet is to backpedal and try and get round them.
  - [ ] Just outside the Boiler Room is a yellow lever that you need to turn.
- [ ] Go inside, pick up some Gunpowder and then go into the back room and look on the board for the Club Key.
- [ ] Take a Wooden Board if you don't already have it. Head back outside.
- [ ] Avoid any zombies that might be wandering around and go up the stairs.
- [ ] Look for a lever near to the burning wreckage and flip it to put out the fire.
- [ ] Go inside the nearby door and go round the corner for a cutscene.
- [ ] Yes, Mr. X is back.
- [ ] Did you miss him?
- [ ] Note that there are certain rooms that he will not enter which you can use to your advantage.
- [ ] Safe Rooms and Mr. X The following rooms accessible from here are safe (i.e.
- [ ] Mr. X won't enter): Break Room Dark Room Interrogation Room / Observation Room Safe Room under the Goddess Statue S.T.A.R.S. Office Clock Tower If you're able to get to one of these rooms, you can just wait him out - he gets bored after a while and stomps off.
- [ ] Wait for his footsteps to fade and you're good to go.
- [ ] Run back outside and when Mr. X follows you, dodge past him and go back inside.
- [ ] Head west, north and east aroTuhnisd wtheeb sAitret Rusoeosm c oaonkdie gs oto d eonwhnasntcaeir uss. eIfr yeoxup earrieen aceb laen tdo ,t ob oaanardly zthee window thPaet ras ozonmalb Iinef oisr mbaantigoinng on and conpteinrfuoerm waenscte.

- [ ] Look on the table for a Portable Safe (which you can open to obtain a Spare Part).
- [ ] You can grab some Gunpowder from the corpse on the floor.
- [ ] Jump through the broken window, grab the Large- Caliber Ammo x 7 off the table and leave through the Observation Room door.
- [ ] Head back upstairs and go south and west through the Waiting Room.
- [ ] Run around the balcony and go into the Library.
- [ ] We need to get to the Linen Room.
- [ ] Unfortunately, Mr. X stopped us from opening up the direct route when we were here earlier.
- [ ] Head up the ladder to the third floor and into the West Storage Room.
  - [ ] This is not a healthy place to be since there's a zombie and a Licker in here so don't hang around.
- [ ] Hopefully, you'll avoid getting clawed.
  - [ ] From here, go downstairs and through the shower past the S.T.A.R.S. Office.
  - [ ] In this corridor, you can now open up the Linen Room using the Diamond Key.
- [ ] Pick up some Gunpowder and a Portable Safe.
  - [ ] This contains the other Spare Part.
- [ ] Leave the Linen Room and go through the Lounge back into the Library.
- [ ] Go out onto the first floor landing and down the stairs.
  - [ ] If Mr. X is chasing you, you can take refuge under the Goddess Statue.
- [ ] Go south and west through Reception.
- [ ] There are now two Lickers in the western corridor.
  - [ ] If Mr. X isn't chasing you, walk very slowly.
  - [ ] Otherwise run and hope for the best.
- [ ] Fortunately, you boarded the windows earlier so the place isn't also crawling with zombies.
- [ ] Go north at the end and use the Club Key to unlock the door to the Records Room (you can discard the key now).
- [ ] Pick up the Tool from the table in here.
- [ ] There's a Hand Grenade and Gunpowder that you can pick up here as well.
- [ ] You may want to take a G+R+B Herb for damage protection because there are two Lickers outside the door and in all likelihood Mr. X as well.
- [ ] Head back out and run back to the Main Hall.
- [ ] Go up the stairs and into the Library.
- [ ] Look for the row of moveable bookshelves.
- [ ] One of them cannot be moved because it's raised on some sort of trolley device.
- [ ] Use the Tool that you picked up a minute ago to free it.
- [ ] Grab the leftmost bookcase and move it one space to the right - our earlier preparations really paid off here.
- [ ] Moving the shelves forms a bridge under the broken walkway above you.
- [ ] Quickly climb the ladder to the upper walkway and exit through the now-accessible door to the east.
  - [ ] You will find yourself on a third floor balcony overlooking the Main Hall.
- [ ] Go all the way south and enter the door to your right to find yourself in the Clock Tower.
- [ ] You are safe here.
- [ ] Look for a mechanism with cogs in the corner.
- [ ] Use the Large Gear on it to lower some stairs that you can use to get to the upper level.
- [ ] IMPORTANT: take the Large Gear with you.
- [ ] Go round the bell cage and up the stairs.
- [ ] Look for another mechanism on the upper level.
- [ ] Exapamritnneer ist. toP rrievcaeciyv eP oal iScymall Gear and place your Large Gear in the mechanismA. cRcuenp tb aCcoko dkoiewsn the stairs and look for another mechanism near the cage.
- [ ] Use your Small Gear to fire up the works.
- [ ] The bell will dislodge another orange box containing the second Electronic Part.
  - [ ] If ypoaur twnearnst. tPor, ivyoacuy c Paonl igcoy out through the door to the west, follow the corridor aroAucncde patn Cd opoickkie usp a Gunpowder (Large).
  - [ ] This does take a little while, however.
- [ ] Leave the Clocktower the way you came in.
- [ ] Grab a Green Herb from just outside the door and run to the opposite corner, avoiding a zombie on your way, and unlock the door leading to the East Storeroom.
- [ ] Run straight through and down one flight of stairs.
- [ ] Make your way south past the Art Room and out through the southwest exit and down the fire escape.
- [ ] Go back into the building and go north through the Watchman's Room.
- [ ] Be careful, however, because the corridor outside may be hostile.
- [ ] Continue north and go into the Break Room to save your game and pick up the other Electronic Part if you need it.
- [ ] Stash the Spare Parts from the portable safes - we'll get the Hip Pouch later.
- [ ] Leave the Break Room and go down the stairs to the north.
  - [ ] You'll find yourself back in the basement area.
- [ ] Go south and west to get to the Parking Garage and then run across to the southern door to the jail area.
- [ ] Make your way round to Ben's cell and use both Electronic Parts on the device on the wall.
- [ ] You now have to manipulate elements to join up the input wires on the left to the output wire on the right.
- [ ] Each time you interact with a square you will rotate it though ninety degrees.
- [ ] Numbering the squares 1-16 left to right and top to bottom, here's a solution: 1, 3, 6, 9, 10, 10, 10, 11, 14, 15 (10 moves total).
  - [ ] This will open the door to Ben's cell.
- [ ] Go inside and pick up the First Aid Spray from beside the toilet and collect the Parking Garage Key Card from Ben's remains.
  - [ ] After the cutscene, all hell will break loose as the cells are opened and zombies pour into the hallway.
- [ ] Quickly run out of the cell and pull the lever on the nearby wall to open up an alternative path out.
- [ ] Start down it only to meet Mr. X coming the other way.
  - [ ] Return and use the slightly more open area to avoid him and run back down the passage.
- [ ] Take care to avoid any zombies on your way out and get to the Parking Garage for a cutscene where Ada saves your behind.
  - [ ] After the scene, use your key card on the card reader to raise the grille.
  - [ ] You'll be pleased to know that Mr. X is no longer chasing you all the time This next bit's a little slow.
- [ ] Ada isn't the fastest walker in the world, so jog and she'll keep up.
- [ ] There's a Green Herb immediately to your right.
- [ ] Go north and east across the street to a store called Gun Shop Kendo.
- [ ] Wait for Ada to open the door (some time this week would be nice).
  - [ ] Once inside go left to find a Hand Grenade and look on the shelf nearby for the Long Barrel (W-870) accessory for your Shotgun.
- [ ] Go towards the back of the shop to pick up Large-Caliber Ammo x 3 and then out of the back for a cutscene.
  - [ ] Afterwards, go through the gate to the east.

## Sewers

- [ ] Jog around the scaffolding and into the pipe leading to the sewers.
  - [ ] Once in the pipe, follow it round.
  - [ ] When you get towards the end of this section, go all the way south to find Large-Caliber Ammo x 4.
  - [ ] Now go down the narrow tunnel leading west, where you'll see something mildly disturbing, and continue to find a Safe Room where you can save your game.
- [ ] Leave through the gate leading west and go north up the tunnel.
  - [ ] When you get to the top, go into the concrete platform, pick up the Large-Caliber Ammo x 3 and go down the steps.
- [ ] Follow the metal walkway and drop off the end for a brief cutscene.
  - [ ] When you regain control you will be running for your life from a giant, infected alligator.
  - [ ] This next sequence is refreshingly simple.

- [ ] Head down the steps and go north and all the way southeast around a structure.
  - [ ] When you see this guy, you can go around the box to his right to avoid getting chewed.
- [ ] Personally, I'd shoot him in the head enough times to make him drop so that he doesn't screw you over on the way back.
- [ ] Continue west and north (if you draw your Visualizer you will be able to see that you are following a wire).
- [ ] A zombie will drop down as you run but ignore it.
- [ ] Use it as an indicator that you're close to the switch that you want to hack.

- [ ] Deal with it and head north along the walkway.
- [ ] You may find a couple more undead as you make your way through the room.

- [ ] There are other codes you can use, but the rewards aren't necessarily worthwhile.
- [ ] Try and get to the Dark Room without getting chewed up too much and develop the Roll Film that you picked up earlier.

- [ ] The correct combination is 2, 3 and 4.
- [ ] Approach the door to see a massive claw come through the ceiling.
- [ ] Unlike the A scenario, there isn't a safe corner to hide in so just run around and hope that the RNG gods are your side.

- [ ] Hit the left hand switch as soon as you can.
- [ ] Pick up a Flash Grenade and a Combat Knife while you're here.

  - [ ] When that happens, quickly hit the right hand switch on the crane controls.
- [ ] Hopefully, G-2 will stay down long enough for the container to hit him.
  - [ ] As previously, the prominent shoulder eye is a weakpoint and another eye has grown out of his back which is an even weaker point.
- [ ] You need to hit him with the container twice or bring him down to one knee three times and hit him with the container once.
  - [ ] If you need it, the arena also has Large-Caliber Ammo x 8 to pick up along with MAG Ammo x 3.
  - [ ] After the fight, a new path will have opened up that takes you to the Garbage Room.

- [ ] Place your dispenser in the cryogenic machine to create Herbicide.
  - [ ] Return to the Greenhouse via the ladder and make your way to the Control Room.
- [ ] Don't bother with enemies on the way because we're about to change them up anyway.
- [ ] Use the vial of Herbicide in the Dispenser Machine to destroy some of the growth in the Greenhouse allowing you access to the dead scientist with the level 3 wristband.
- [ ] Arm yourself with your flamethrower and a Combat Knife.
- [ ] On your way to pick up the wristband, it is important that you clear a path back to the Control Room.
- [ ] You don't need to kill the Ivies - just get them on their backs kicking and screaming; when they get up again, you'll be long gone.
- [ ] Pick up the wristband and increase your clearance to level 3.
- [ ] Run back to the Control Room, through the Presentation Room and into the Lobby and save your game.
  - [ ] Return to the central shaft and use your level 3 clearance to open up a path to the Lab Area West.
- [ ] Go across and though the door.
- [ ] Pick up the Hand Grenade from the floor next to the dead soldier and continue to the next room.
- [ ] Examine the Signal Modulator, set it to "AWS" and twiddle the knobs until the waveforms look like this. You can now discard the Signal Modulator.

### Bioreactors Room

- [ ] Head west. Bioreactors Room and continue through the decontamination area.
  - [ ] When you get to the end, pick up the virus sample from its container.
  - [ ] Just across the way is a Safe Room with some goodies: Large Gunpowder, High Grade Gunpowder and a Red Herb.
- [ ] Prepare yourself for a major boss fight.
- [ ] The flamethrower will be useful here along with your shotgun and Lightning Hawk.
- [ ] Be careful not to use up all your ammo, though, because this isn't the final (or even penultimate) boss!
- [ ] You want at least three full heals (you should have a decent amount of G+R+B herbs at this point).
- [ ] Don't bring knives - the boss doesn't appear to grab you - but Hand Grenades are always good if you can spare them.
- [ ] Save your game.

### Birkin (G-3)

- [ ] Head back through the Bioreactors Room for a massive cutscene after which you're thrown into battle with Birkin in his G-3 form.
- [ ] You goal is to destroy the eyes on his body then target the eye complex that appears in his chest.
- [ ] Try and be on the move at all times and make sure that you target the eyes because shooting the rest of him doesn't do too much good.
- [ ] The flamer can be effective at targeting all the eyes at once.
  - [ ] If he gets uncomfortably close, a shotgun blast directly to an eye can stagger him.
  - [ ] If he picks up something to throw, try and shoot an eye with a high damage weapon to get him to drop it.
  - [ ] When the central eye complex pops out (you'll know it when you see it), switch to the Lightning Hawk and deliver multiple shots right where it hurts him the most.
  - [ ] It may take a couple of goes and all your healing items that you brought, but you should be able to manage it eventually.
- [ ] During and after the fight, be sure to pick up the goodies dotted around (Large-Caliber Ammo x 48, MAG Ammo x 2, Fuel x 200, a Hand Grenade, 2 Flash Grenades and a First Aid Spray).
  - [ ] When you're done looting, take the lift up out of the arena for another cutscene.

## Escape & Final Bosses

- [ ] Afterwards, run back out of the West Lab Area to the central shaft for another cutscene (you might want to use the item box on the way).
  - [ ] When this finishes, the lift down will be open and a countdown will begin.
- [ ] You have ten minutes to get out.
- [ ] Take the lift down (it only takes the best part of a minute!) for another brief cutscene.
  - [ ] Afterwards, head through to the next area and save your game.
- [ ] Arm yourself with your flamethrower and go through the exit.
- [ ] Take the lift down a short way.
- [ ] There are 3 Ivies through here - flame them until they drop and run past them.
  - [ ] In the next area go down a ladder.
- [ ] Guess who shows up?
- [ ] Kite Mr. X around the walkway and go though the next door.
- [ ] A zombie will appear in your path - use your shotgun if it's a threat.
- [ ] Go through the next door for another cutscene.
- [ ] Go though a final door.
- [ ] There's another item box.
- [ ] You need to leave two spaces in your inventory.
  - [ ] As it happens, the flamethrower is not terribly effective against the next boss so you can put that away to free up the necessary space.
- [ ] Equip yourself for a major boss fight.
- [ ] Hand Grenades and Flash Grenades are really good - as many as you can manage.
- [ ] Bring all the healing items you can fit into your inventory.
- [ ] Hopefully, the G-3 battle didn't leave you too depleted and you have at least a few rounds of MAG Ammo.
- [ ] Pick up the Joint Plug and use it on the nearby lift control.

### Super Tyrant

- [ ] Unfortunately, Mr. X, now in his Super Tyrant form, has other ideas.
  - [ ] This is an endurance contest (and easier than the G-3 fight).
- [ ] You need to survive for a certain amount of time.
- [ ] At some point, a large piece of masonry falls into the battle arena.
  - [ ] If you hide behind it you can avoid his attacks. Flash Grenades will stun him briefly, giving you the opportunity to attack.
- [ ] His weak point is his exposed heart.
  - [ ] After surviving for a while, you will have a cutscene where Ada drops you a Rocket Launcher.
- [ ] Pick it up when it's safe to do so and fire a single rocket at Mr. X's upper body to being the fight to a conclusion.
  - [ ] You will go to investigate what the source of the sound was.
- [ ] Save your game if you like.
- [ ] Use the item box.
- [ ] Get your flamethrower back and pick up the M19 along with any Large-Caliber Ammo you may have.
  - [ ] Just in case you need it after the previous two boss fights.
- [ ] And make sure you've still got the Rocket Launcher.

### Birkin (G-5)

- [ ] Go through the rear carriages until you come across the final, final boss, Birkin in his G-5 form.
- [ ] There's a secret to this boss: the more he advances, the more damage your attacks do.
- [ ] Open up with your flamethrower (or whatever you have - even the M19 will do).
  - [ ] When Leon can't go back any further, bring out the Rocket Launcher and send two rockets into the big central eye.
- [ ] Enjoy the final, final cutscenes.
