## Build snapshot

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Start or end turns in stealth, use Advantage to land Sneak Attacks, and spend bonus actions to reposition, hide, and keep pressure while staying hard to pin down.**

### About companion
- Astarion is a **Rogue (Thief)** companion built around **stealth, scouting, lockpicking, and trap disarming**, with strong ranged burst when he can secure Advantage.
- He brings a **unique Vampire Bite** tool for emergency self-sustain and opportunistic damage without breaking stealth in the right situations.
- He performs best when you **deploy him as a flanker/scout**, picking angles, high ground, and safe lines of fire rather than trading hits up close.

### Party role
- **Scout & utility:** checks ahead, disarms traps, picks locks, and handles exploration friction.
- **Ranged burst damage:** deletes priority targets when you can reliably set up Advantage/Sneak Attack.
- **Skirmisher:** uses bonus-action movement tools to disengage, re-hide, and reset fights on his terms.

### Pros
- High damage when Advantage + Sneak Attack are online
- Excellent exploration utility (locks/traps/scouting)
- Thief bonus actions create flexible, repeatable turns

### Cons
- Limited durability if exposed or focused
- Relies on positioning/stealth setup to feel “online”
- Doesn’t bring spellcasting by default (in this guide’s main route)

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Cunning Actions** (Hide/Dash/Disengage as a bonus action)
- Level 3: **Thief** (extra bonus action + fall resistance feature)
- Level 4: **Sharpshooter** (big ranged damage option, toggleable risk)
- Level 8 / 10 / 12: more feat scaling (DEX + Lucky + DEX)

## Level-by-level progression (Rogue 1 → 12)
> Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop for deploying Astarion effectively.

### Level 1 — Rogue 1
**Gain**
- **Vampire Bite** (unique to Astarion)
- **Sneak Attack (Ranged & Melee)**

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Deploy Astarion to **open from stealth** when possible, or to **end his turn hidden** when fights get messy.
- Use **Sneak Attack** when Advantage is available (stealth positioning, high ground angles, or targets already engaged by your frontline).
- Save **Vampire Bite** for moments where he needs **emergency sustain** or a safe, opportunistic bite that doesn’t compromise his positioning plan.

### Level 2 — Rogue 2
**Gain**
- **Cunning Action: Hide**
- **Cunning Action: Dash**
- **Cunning Action: Disengage**

**Play style (Level 2)**
- The loop becomes more consistent: **bonus-action Hide → attack for Sneak Attack**.
- Use **Dash** to claim high ground / angles without giving up the action you need for damage.
- Use **Disengage** to survive contact—Astarion is more valuable alive and repositioning than trading hits.

### Level 3 — Rogue 3 (Thief)
**Subclass**
- **Thief**

**Gain**
- **Fast Hands** (Gain an additional Bonus Action)
- **Second-Story Work** (Resistance to Falling damage)

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Two bonus actions means you can **Hide + reposition** in the same turn more often, or **Hide even after movement adjustments**.
- Treat bonus actions as your “survival and setup budget”: if the line looks dangerous, spend them to **re-hide and reset**, not to stand and fight.

### Level 4 — Rogue 4
**Feat**
- **Sharpshooter**

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Use Sharpshooter as a **toggle**: keep it on when your setup is strong (Advantage, clean shot), and turn it off when accuracy matters more than raw damage.
- The field goal stays the same: **secure Advantage, land Sneak Attack, stay safe**.

### Level 5 — Rogue 5
**Gain**
- **Uncanny Dodge** (take half damage from an attack that hits you)
- Sneak Attack scaling (as presented in source context)

**Play style (Level 5)**
- You can afford slightly riskier peeks, but don’t change the identity: **burst from safety, then vanish/reposition**.
- Keep scouting for damage amplifiers (arrows, poisons, coatings) to make each Sneak Attack count.

### Level 6 — Rogue 6
**Gain**
- **Expertise: Deception**
- **Expertise: Acrobatics**

**Play style (Level 6)**
- This level is mostly “field utility”: Astarion becomes even better at **dialogue/exploration checks** while maintaining the same combat loop.
- In fights, keep him doing what he does best: **angles, stealth, precision damage**.

### Level 7 — Rogue 7
**Gain**
- **Evasion** (DEX-save effects: no damage on success; half on fail)

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Evasion improves survivability against common threats, but the correct deployment remains: **avoid being targeted in the first place**.
- If the battlefield is spell-heavy, treat Astarion as a **mobile shooter**—don’t anchor him in predictable positions.

### Level 8 — Rogue 8
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Dexterity** (as presented in source)

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Higher Dexterity supports the same plan: **more reliable ranged output**, better initiative/accuracy, cleaner Sneak Attack turns.
- Keep prioritizing **high ground + safe sightlines** over “more attacks.”

### Level 9 — Rogue 9 (Thief)
**Gain**
- **Supreme Sneak** (become Invisible)

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Use Supreme Sneak primarily as an **out-of-combat repositioning and avoidance tool** (it costs an action).
- In combat, rely on the classic loop: **bonus-action Hide for Advantage**, then strike.

### Level 10 — Rogue 10
**Feat**
- **Lucky**

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Lucky is your “make this moment happen” tool: use it on **critical attacks, saves, or checks** when the outcome matters.
- It supports Astarion’s identity: **consistent execution under pressure** when stealth setups get disrupted.

### Level 11 — Rogue 11
**Gain**
- **Reliable Talent** (for proficient skills, lowest roll becomes 10)

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Reliable Talent strengthens Astarion as a **field specialist**: lockpicking, stealthing, disarming, and key checks become more dependable.
- Keep his combat role disciplined: **precision damage, minimal exposure**.

### Level 12 — Rogue 12
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Dexterity** (as presented in source)

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Max out the “clean shooter” identity: **secure Advantage, land Sneak Attack, and keep yourself untouchable through position and stealth**.
- If fights turn chaotic, Astarion should be the one who **escapes, repositions, and re-engages**, not the one who stands and gets focused down.
