## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Vampire Bite: You suck the blood from a living creature and regain 2d4 hit points. The target takes 2d4 Piercing damage, unless it is unconscious, or you are Hiding. Biting a creature does not break stealth. You will need to long rest to use it again.
  - Sneak Attack (Ranged & Melee): Deal additional damage to an enemy you have Advantage against (Once per turn).
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Get into stealth before a fight (or during), then use a sneak attack.
    - Turn 2+: Look for high ground, targets who are engaged in melee battle, and stealth constantly to trigger extra damage.
  - Notes:
    - To gain Advantage, you need to be hiding or the enemy to be engaged with another within 1.5 meters.
    - You can enable “auto sneak attack” (or use the ask button) so you can attack normally and Sneak Attack triggers when Advantage is present.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Cunning Action: Hide (bonus action)
  - Cunning Action: Dash (bonus action)
  - Cunning Action: Disengage (bonus action)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use your bonus action to Hide, gain Advantage, and then use Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Use Dash to create space/close distance, Disengage to flee without opportunity attacks, and Hide at the end of the turn to go into stealth.
  - Notes:
    - Try to start encounters from stealth.
    - During dialogue, you can select the character screen and move the non-talking party members to an ideal area: buff up, get in stealth, and open with a big stealth attack.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Thief
  - Fast Hands: Gain an additional bonus action.
  - Second-Story Work: You’ve mastered the art of falling and gaining Resistance to Falling damage.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use bonus actions to gain Advantage (Hide) and attack.
    - Turn 2+: Use bonus actions to apply oils or poison to weapons; use Misty Step; use off-hand attacks in conjunction with potions.
  - Notes:
    - With two bonus actions per turn, you can now do more in a turn while still setting up Sneak Attack.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Feat: Sharpshooter (recommended)
    - Your ranged weapon attacks do not receive penalties from High Ground Rules.
    - Ranged weapon attacks with weapons you are Proficient with have a -5 penalty to their Attack Roll but deal an additional 10 damage.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Open from stealth and use ranged attacks (with Sneak Attack when you have Advantage).
    - Turn 2+: Keep Sharpshooter toggled as preferred; hide and snipe with a sneak attack at range.
  - Notes:
    - You can toggle Sharpshooter off via passives, but still get the high-ground rule.
    - Alternative mentioned: Dual Wielder feat for a double Rapier dual-wield build (off-hand attacks with a bonus action), but your bonus action often goes to hiding to get a sneak attack.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Uncanny Dodge: When an attack hits you, you only take half the usual damage.
  - Sneak Attack damage increased to 3d6.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue stealth opener into Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Continue the same loop (Hide for Advantage → Sneak Attack).
  - Notes:
    - Look for gear, potions, arrows, and poison to amplify damage.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Expertise in two skills: Deception and Acrobatics (good choices).
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue stealth opener into Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Continue the same loop.
  - Notes:
    - This helps in overland, dialogue, and exploration rather than combat generally.

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Evasion: When a spell or effect would deal half damage on a successful Dexterity Saving Throw, it deals no damage if you succeed, and only half damage if you fail.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue stealth opener into Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Continue the same loop.
  - Notes:
    - Gameplay remains unchanged.

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Dexterity), intended to reach 18.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue stealth opener into Sneak Attack at range.
    - Turn 2+: Continue the same loop.
  - Notes:
    - This allows for huge damage with sneak attacks at range.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Supreme Sneak: Blend into the environment so completely that you become Invisible (usable every short rest; costs an action).
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue stealth opener into Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Use on-demand Invisibility after you disengage and run away from attackers and heal up with bonus action.
  - Notes:
    - Out of combat, it’s a great way to sneak around and avoid detection and punishment.

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Feat: Lucky
    - Gain 3 Luck Points to gain Advantage on Attack Rolls, Ability Checks, or Saving Throws, or to make an enemy reroll their Attack Rolls.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use your action primarily for a sneak attack.
    - Turn 2+: Use Luck Points in critical situations where you need an extra d20 (via reaction).
  - Notes:
    - You will need to long rest to replenish your Luck points.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Reliable Talent: When you make an Ability Check with a Skill you are Proficient with it, the lowest result you can roll on the die is 10.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue stealth opener into Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Continue the same loop.
  - Notes:
    - Not much happens with the Rogue Thief build at this level; you are one level from another feat.

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Dexterity), reaching 20 Dexterity.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Simple ranged combat loop (stealth → Sneak Attack).
    - Turn 2+: Continue the same loop.
  - Notes:
    - This build excels at simple ranged combat and is amazing outside-of-combat utility.

## Features and Mechanics
- Companions can be avoided entirely, killed, romanced, and each has a sprawling background.
- Your companion can be respecced or rerolled early in the game (class, subclass, ability score, and more). The only feature that cannot be adjusted is their race and story; suggested to use Withers at Camp after he’s unlocked.
- Where to find Astarion and how to recruit him: Ravaged Beach, to the northwest of where you land after the Nautiloid ship crash. Approach and he will ask for help attacking an Intellect Devourer; this is a trick and Astarion will attack. The mind flayer parasites connected to both of your brains will prevent him from killing you; during the dialogue, agree and he will join your party.
- Sneak Attack Explained: Deal extra damage to a target if you have Advantage on the attack roll. The easiest way to get Advantage is to start combat in stealth or have a target that is attacking / engaged with another.
- Cunning Action: Dash, Hide, and Disengage as a bonus action (bonus actions are the theme of the build).
- Thief: Fast Hands (additional bonus action) and Second-Story Work (Resistance to Falling damage).
- Supreme Sneak: become Invisible (usable every short rest; costs an action).
- Uncanny Dodge: half damage when an attack hits you.
- Evasion: succeed Dexterity save for no damage (or half on fail) when an effect would deal half on save.
- Reliable Talent: the lowest result you can roll on the die is 10 for Ability Checks with skills you are Proficient with.
- Titanstring Bow note: “Regarding Titanstring Bow, you can use Elixir of Hill Giant Strength to add +5 damage for every attack! Consider using these until long rest Elixir if you acquire the bow because it makes the weapon radically more powerful early in BG3.”

## Subclass Options
### Rogue Subclasses
- Thief: Thieves can pick locks, disarm traps, and move quickly and quietly. They also get several bonus actions that they can use to gain an edge in combat.
- Arcane Trickster: Arcane Tricksters can cast spells, use magic items, and even sneak attack while invisible.

3. High Ground: Use elevation to improve accuracy with a ranged weapon.
4. Consumables: Consume a potion of speed or shoot a fire arrow at range for increased combat effectiveness.
5. Prepare: Always get in sneak with Control + C prior to combat.

7. Movement: Use the cunning dash to close the distance while still allowing an action.
8. Disengage: You can move to the flank or back of the opposition while in an engagement without taking an opportunity to attack.
9. Vampire Bite: When in desperate need of healing, use Vampire Bite to do damage and return some health.
10. Grouping: You can ungroup as an Astarion Rogue, then break away from your group and set up a high-ground position when the fight starts.
