## Character Creation
- Race: Zariel Tiefling
- Class: Barbarian
- Subclass: Berserker
- Background: Outlander
- Ability Scores: STR: 16, DEX: 14, CON: 16, INT: 8, WIS: 12, CHA: 8
- Proficiencies: Light, Medium, Shields, Simple weapons; Skill Proficiencies: Perception and Intimidation

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Unarmored Defense: While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
  - Rage: While raging, you deal 2 extra damage with melee and improvised weapons, and when throwing objects. You also have Resistance to physical damage and Advantage on Strength checks and Saving Throws. Rage ends early if you don’t attack an enemy or take damage each turn. You can’t cast or concentrate on spells while raging.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage, charge in and attack.
    - Turn 2+: Keep Rage active by attacking or taking damage each turn.
  - Notes:
    - You want to either use medium armor or clothing, and a two-handed weapon preferably Greatsword.
    - Make sure to have a ranged weapon equipped so you can always attack once per turn to keep Rage active.
    - You can get a super powerful one in the prologue section called the Everburn Blade.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Reckless Attack: Gain Advantage on melee weapon attack rolls in exchange for granting advantage to enemies attacking you until your next turn.
  - Danger Sense: Advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws against traps, spells, and surfaces.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage and charge into combat.
    - Turn 2+: Use Reckless for the majority of your attacks.
  - Notes:
    - This should be used against an enemy you will either kill or won’t target your next turn.
    - Make sure to equip a bow in case you cannot reach a target on your first turn.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Berserker
  - Extra Rage Charge
  - Frenzied Strike: As a bonus action, make a melee attack with your equipped weapon.
  - Enraged Throw: Pick up an item or creature and throw it at a target, dealing Bludgeoning damage and knocking it Prone. Your Strength affects how much weight you can throw. Heavier items deal more damage. The damage of Thrown Weapons is the same as the Weapon’s melee damage. You also deal additional damage based on your Strength.
  - Frenzy: Enter a frenzied rage as a bonus action, allowing you to make an additional melee weapon attack on each of your turns; incurs one level of exhaustion once your rage ends.
  - Searing Smite (Karlach Racial Unlock): 1d6 Fire damage; a target with Searing Smite takes 1d6 Fire damage every turn, until it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Frenzy (formally Rage), charge in for Reckless Attack (melee or at range).
    - Turn 2+: Action attack (Reckless), then bonus action attack (Frenzied Strike or Enraged Throw).
  - Notes:
    - Enraged Throw can knock an enemy prone, effectively stunning them.
    - The weakness of the Karlach Barbarian is the lack of crowd control, NOT the lack of damage.
    - If you use Frenzied Strike or Enraged Throw on every turn, you will get knocked out of Frenzy; limit it if possible.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvements (put two points into Strength; increase Strength to 18)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage/Frenzy, charge in with Reckless Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Continue with Reckless Attack; use bonus action attacks as needed.
  - Notes:
    - “We don’t recommend Great Weapon Master feat at this level.”

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Extra Attack: Make two attacks when you take the Attack action on your turn.
  - Fast Movement: Increases your movement speed by +5 while not wearing heavy armor.
  - Branding Smite (Karlach’s race): 2d6 radiant damage; possibly marks your target with light, preventing it from turning Invisible.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage/Frenzy, charge in with Reckless Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Action for 2x attacks (Extra Attack), then a bonus action strike depending on range.
  - Notes:
    - Extra Attack paired with Frenzied Strike allows multiple attacks with actions and another with a bonus action.
    - “You can drink a Potion of Speed for a further effect and do a lot of damage in one turn.”
    - Branding Smite uses an action and a bonus action and can prevent invisibility.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Additional Rage charge
  - Mindless Rage: While Frenzied, you can’t be Charmed or Frightened, and Calm Emotions no longer end your rage.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage/Frenzy and stay aggressive.
    - Turn 2+: Maintain Frenzy while using Reckless Attack as primary damage.
  - Notes:
    - Helps you become immune to annoying crowd control effects and keeps you from losing damage or missing turns.
    - Grymforge has powerful armor and weapons (Adamantine) that can aid you well into Act 3.

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Feral Instinct: +3 bonus to Initiative and can’t be surprised.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Start early in combat and focus on a highest priority target.
    - Turn 2+: Continue standard melee pressure with Reckless Attack and bonus action usage.
  - Notes:
    - You are guaranteed to go during the first round of combat and will be one of the first to start.

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Feat: Great Weapon Master
    - On a critical hit or kill, make another melee attack as a bonus action.
    - Heavy weapon attacks: -5 attack roll penalty, +10 damage (toggle in Passive section).
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Initiate combat using your action first, saving your bonus action for a Great Weapon Master attack (on proc).
    - Turn 2+: Use bonus action for Great Weapon Master attacks rather than Frenzied Strike or Enraged Throw when you critically strike or kill a target.
  - Notes:
    - If you fail to trigger the Great Weapon Master effect, you can still use Frenzied Strike or Enraged Throw.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Brutal Critical: When you land a Critical Hit, you roll an extra damage die as well as the normal additional critical dice.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Standard opening (Rage/Frenzy if needed), then attacks.
    - Turn 2+: Continue attacks; benefit is passive.
  - Notes:
    - “Not much changes besides passive benefits like Brutal Critical.”

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Intimidating Presence: Menace an enemy and instill a terrible Fear within them. If the target resists this effect, it can’t be targeted again until it Long Rests.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Standard opening and damage plan.
    - Turn 2+: Maintain pressure with attacks and bonus action management.
  - Notes:
    - Requires an action and only does fear (gives a disadvantage).

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Fighter (multiclass): Great Weapon Fighting Style, Second Wind
  - Great Weapon Fighting Style: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack with a two-handed melee weapon, that die is rerolled once.
  - Second Wind: Bonus action heal.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Standard opening; use actions for attacks.
    - Turn 2+: Continue; use Second Wind if needed (bonus action).
  - Notes:
    - At level 11 the Barbarian gets Relentless Rage (if you stay Barbarian): If you drop to 0 health, you have 1 health instead of being Downed.
    - The suggestion to multiclass is purely for Action Surge at level 12.

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Fighter 2: Action Surge (once per short rest)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use attacks, then Action Surge for another action (and Extra Attack applies).
    - Turn 2+: Continue; combine with Great Weapon Master procs when available.
  - Notes:
    - “Given the Barbarian already has an extra attack, those extra two attacks combined with Great Weapon Master are worth sacrificing Relentless Rage and +2 Strength.”
    - If you stay entirely Barbarian: take Ability Improvement +2 Strength at level 12 (or the Alert feat, which helps with going early).

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Use Rage Wisely: Activate this and stay aggressive. You need to either do damage or be damaged so play up close.
- Initial Turn: Make sure your initial move either puts you in melee range so you can strike or attack with range to keep Rage active.
- Bonus Action: Once you get Frenzied Strike, you can attack with a bonus action, using two attacks in one turn so don’t waste it.
- Prioritize melee combat: Use different weapons based on their strength and unique skills, like Cleave for Area damage.
- Manage Frenzy: Make sure you have at least two charges left on your Frenzy so that if you are disabled or lose the buff, you can require it during a long fight.
- Reckless Attack: use this attack when it’s likely you will not receive a return blow.
- Potion of Speed: use these potions to gain bigger movement and more actions in challenging fights.
- Enraged Throw: this skill can be useful when you need to keep Rage or Frenzy active, but don’t have the movement.
- Long Rest: Make sure to rest when your Rage and Frenzy counters are low so you start with many available.
- Great Weapon Master: try to target low-health enemies with a high chance of hit so you can proc a free extra attack if you kill them.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative Karlach Barbarian Build (Throw build with the Giant subclass):
  - This build shifts the focus from traditional melee combat to a more ranged and tactical approach, allowing you to deal significant damage from a safer distance.
  - By investing six levels into Giant Barbarian, you unlock Elemental Cleaver, a feature that enables you to throw nearly any weapon with added elemental effects.
  - When combined with the Tavern Brawler feat, thrown weapons become high-impact projectiles.
  - “What makes this build especially appealing is its consistency across all three Acts of the game.”
- Alternative build level progression:
  - Level 1: Barbarian — Unarmored Defense, Rage
  - Level 2: Barbarian — Reckless Attack, Danger Sense
  - Level 3: Barbarian — Subclass: Giant, Giant’s Rage, Thaumaturgy
  - Level 4: Barbarian — Feat: Tavern Brawler

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 introduces a major shift for Barbarians with the arrival of the Giant subclass, a new path that focuses entirely on throwing weapons.
- Patch 8 also brings updates to spells and cantrips, with Booming Blade emerging as a particularly useful tool:
  - This melee cantrip adds bonus thunder damage on hit, boosting burst potential, especially when enemies move.
  - You can gain Booming Blade at character creation by choosing the High Elf race (single cantrip), but if you are playing as Karlach, you cannot change her race.
