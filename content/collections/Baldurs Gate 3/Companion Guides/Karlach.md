## Build snapshot

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Deploy Karlach as your front-line wrecking ball: open with Rage, force close-range trades, and chain high-value swings while staying aggressive to keep momentum and pressure.**

### About companion
- Karlach is a **Zariel Tiefling Barbarian (Berserker)** built to **win fights by committing to melee**, staying in the thick of it, and overwhelming targets through repeated pressure.
- She performs best when you **deploy her early into contact**: get in range, start the Rage loop, and keep hitting or taking hits so her engine never drops.
- Her combat identity is “simple and brutal”: **pick a priority, delete it, then roll forward**—with extra attack layers later that can explode turns when you need it.

### Party role
- **Primary melee damage:** takes space and removes priority targets through direct pressure.
- **Frontline anchor:** soaks attention and stays functional through durability + aggression.
- **Simple finisher:** converts kills/crit windows into additional pressure later in the build’s progression (as presented in source context).

### Pros
- Soul Coin Bonus
- Amazing Story
- Great Melee Combatant

### Cons
- Soul Coin Bonus Conflicts with Others in the Party
- Requires Dammon
- Melee Focused

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Reckless Attack + Danger Sense**
- Level 3: **Berserker** (Frenzy, Frenzied Strike, Enraged Throw)
- Level 5: **Extra Attack + Fast Movement** (plus racial unlock at this level, as presented in source)
- Level 8: **Great Weapon Master**
- Level 12: **Action Surge** (via Fighter multiclass in this guide)

## Level-by-level progression (Barbarian 1 → 10, Fighter 11 → 12)
> Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop for deploying Karlach effectively.

### Level 1 — Barbarian 1
**Gain**
- **Unarmored Defense**
- **Rage**

**Play style (Level 1)**
- First turn default: spend your **bonus action** to activate **Rage**, then **charge into contact** (as presented in source context).
- Your priority is to **keep Rage active** by either **hitting a target** or **taking damage** each turn; carry a **ranged weapon** so you can still “tag” a target if you can’t reach melee (as presented in source context).
- Early foundation is straightforward: **get in range, swing hard, and stay aggressive** (as presented in source context).

### Level 2 — Barbarian 2
**Gain**
- **Reckless Attack**
- **Danger Sense**

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Use **Reckless Attack** for the majority of your attacks (as presented in source context), but treat it as a risk tool: it’s best when you **expect the target to die** or **won’t be able to punish you** before your next turn.
- Your turn plan stays consistent: **Rage on turn one**, then keep the engine running by staying in contact and trading (as presented in source context).
- **Danger Sense** is passive; it improves your reliability against traps/surfaces/spell pressure (as presented in source context).

### Level 3 — Barbarian 3 (Berserker)
**Subclass**
- **Berserker**

**Gain**
- **Extra Rage Charge** (as presented in source)
- **Frenzy** (Rage becomes Frenzy in this guide’s framing)
- **Frenzied Strike** (bonus action melee attack; adds Frenzied Strain; removed when Frenzy ends)
- **Enraged Throw** (pick up item/creature and throw; damage depends on weight/size; can knock targets **Prone**)
- **Searing Smite** (racial unlock at level 3, as presented in source)

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Core loop expands: first turn **Frenzy** (bonus action) and **close the distance**, striking either in melee or at range if needed to keep the state active (as presented in source context).
- Second turn: use your **action** first, then decide if you spend a **bonus action** on **Frenzied Strike** or **Enraged Throw** depending on range and control needs (as presented in source context).
- **Enraged Throw** is a key field tool because it can **knock a target Prone**, helping Karlach cover a control gap (as presented in source context).
- Manage Frenzy usage: using bonus-action attacks every turn can push you out of Frenzy; the guide advises **limiting** how often you spend those bonus-action attacks so you keep Frenzy longer (as presented in source context).

### Level 4 — Barbarian 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Strength** (bringing Strength to 18 in this guide)

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Nothing major changes in the loop, but you become **more consistent** at landing hits and doing damage (as presented in source context).
- The guide explicitly does **not** recommend taking Great Weapon Master here because Berserker already gets strong bonus-action value from subclass tools at this stage (as presented in source context).
- Keep the same job: **commit early, stay in contact, keep the rage engine running** (as presented in source context).

### Level 5 — Barbarian 5
**Gain**
- **Extra Attack** (two attacks when you take the Attack action)
- **Fast Movement** (+5 movement while not wearing heavy armor)
- **Branding Smite** (racial unlock at level 5, as presented in source)

**Play style (Level 5)**
- This is where Karlach starts to “dominate” in the guide’s words (as presented in source context): your turn can become **action attacks + bonus-action attack**, producing very high pressure.
- First turn remains: **Rage/Frenzy** (bonus action), close in, and attack; if you land hits, you’re now chaining more output (as presented in source context).
- Second turn: plan on **two action attacks**, then decide if the **bonus action** is spent on a subclass strike/throw based on range and control needs (as presented in source context).
- In hard fights, the guide calls out using a **Potion of Speed** to add even more attacks (as presented in source context).

### Level 6 — Barbarian 6
**Gain**
- **Additional Rage charge** (as presented in source)
- **Mindless Rage** (while Frenzied you can’t be Charmed or Frightened; Calm Emotions no longer ends your rage)

**Play style (Level 6)**
- You gain more reliability against “annoying” control that can waste turns or break momentum (as presented in source context).
- The deployment goal stays the same: **keep swinging, keep pressure**, and avoid losing the Rage state to disruption (as presented in source context).
- As you transition out of Act 1, the guide recommends checking vendors, stocking supplies, and grabbing key Act 1 gear before you can’t return (as presented in source context).

### Level 7 — Barbarian 7
**Gain**
- **Feral Instinct** (+3 Initiative and can’t be surprised)

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Higher initiative means you’re more likely to act early and start deleting a high-priority target before it can act (as presented in source context).
- The guide’s framing: you should now be one of the first to move, so you can **stun/disable via field tools** or **eliminate** key threats quickly (as presented in source context).
- Your job doesn’t change: **start fast, hit hard, keep tempo**.

### Level 8 — Barbarian 8
**Feat**
- **Great Weapon Master**

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Great Weapon Master introduces a high-risk option the guide expects you to **toggle**: it adds damage but reduces hit chance; you can turn it off when accuracy matters (as presented in source context).
- The guide’s key usage: if you critically hit or kill, you can make another melee attack as a bonus action; this becomes a preferred bonus-action use because it helps you keep Frenzy longer compared to spending bonus actions every turn on subclass attacks (as presented in source context).
- Combat initiation note from the guide: start with your **action first**, then **save your bonus action** to capitalize on Great Weapon Master follow-ups (as presented in source context).

### Level 9 — Barbarian 9
**Gain**
- **Brutal Critical** (extra damage die on critical hits)

**Play style (Level 9)**
- The guide calls this mostly passive power: you don’t change inputs, you just hit harder on crits (as presented in source context).
- Keep turns simple: **stay aggressive, keep contact, and let the passive scaling do work** (as presented in source context).
- Continue prioritizing targets you can reliably finish to trigger bonus-action follow-ups (as presented in source context).

### Level 10 — Barbarian 10
**Gain**
- **Intimidating Presence** (action-based fear effect; if the target resists, can’t be targeted again until long rest)

**Play style (Level 10)**
- The guide treats this as optional and not core to the build’s typical turn plan (as presented in source context).
- Default loop remains damage-first: use your actions to **attack and remove threats**, and rely on other tools/party members for debuffing if desired (as presented in source context).
- Keep your focus on consistent melee pressure rather than spending turns on low-impact control (as presented in source context).

### Level 11 — Fighter 1 (multiclass in this guide)
**Gain**
- **Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting** (reroll 1s and 2s on damage die for two-handed melee weapon attacks, rerolled once)
- **Second Wind** (bonus-action heal; described as mediocre but usable early in the game, as presented in source)

**Play style (Level 11)**
- This level can feel uneventful in the guide’s framing, but it improves damage reliability on two-handed swings (as presented in source context).
- Keep the same plan: open hard, stay in contact, and look for turns where your bonus action is best spent on Great Weapon Master follow-ups rather than burning Frenzy bonus-action attacks every round (as presented in source context).

### Level 12 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- **Action Surge** (extra action; recharges on short rest, as presented in source)

**Play style (Level 12)**
- This is the guide’s endgame spike: **Extra Attack + Great Weapon Master + Action Surge** produces huge burst potential (as presented in source context).
- In hard fights, the guide explicitly calls out stacking action gain sources (e.g., Haste effects) to create extremely high attack counts (as presented in source context).
- If you choose not to multiclass (not the main route here), the guide notes you could instead remain Barbarian to take **+2 Strength at level 12** or consider **Alert** (as presented in source context). (Not specified in source)
