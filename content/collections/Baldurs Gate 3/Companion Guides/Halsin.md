## Build snapshot

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Transform into a high-HP combat Wild Shape (e.g., Owlbear/Polar Bear) to function as a magical frontline tank that soaks damage and maintains concentration on vital control/damage spells.**

### About companion
- Halsin is a **Druid (Circle of the Moon)** companion specializing in **combat-focused Wild Shape forms** that leverage high temporary HP pools and bonus actions.
- His versatility allows him to rapidly switch between **frontline brawler, area control caster, and emergency healer** depending on the combat phase.
- He excels when deployed to **hold bottlenecks and draw enemy aggression**, using the power of his animal forms to sustain pressure and preserve party resources.

### Party role
- **Frontline Tank & Sustained Damage:** Absorbs massive amounts of damage through high Wild Shape HP and can maintain spell concentration for powerful effects like *Call Lightning* or *Moonbeam* while transformed.

### Level 3 (Gain: Level 2 Spells)
- **Spells:** **Spike Growth** (Massive area denial and damage), **Darkness** (Control/defense), **Flame Blade** (Bonus action melee weapon).
