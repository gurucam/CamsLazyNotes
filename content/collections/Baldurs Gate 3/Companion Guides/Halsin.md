## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Use Bonus Actions: use your bonus action to Wild Shape and heal yourself and don’t let it go to waste.
2. Wild Shape: If a party member needs a heal, come out of the form and support them, then go back on the offensive.
3. Pick Right Form: Use Wild Shape to select a creature with the desired effect like the Bear when you need a tank or Deep Rothé for cc.
4. Rest: make sure to use quick rest and long rest to replenish your spell slots before important fights.
5. Flame Shape: drop this ability in the fray and let it soak up all the damage for your party.
6. Double Healing: use spells like Goodberries and Healing Word to provide healing in one turn.
7. Use Consumables: in critical situations, you can use a Potion of Speed or an ally shot a Fire Arrow to turn the tide of battle.
8. Prone: try to use ice spells to proc the prone status effect so late-game wild-shape forms can do better damage.
9. Extra Attack: make sure to attack twice in Wild Shape form after level 5 to get the most damage out of the build.
10. Opening Turn: use your hard-hitting damage spells as an opener and use a bonus action to go into Wild Shape.

## Alternative Build Route
This alternative Halsin build introduces a Wizard multiclass at Level 8. Centered on the Circle of Spores subclass, it shifts focus from healing and shapeshifting to destructive spellcasting. By branching into the Evocation school, it gains access to Sculpt Spells, allowing you to cast area-of-effect magic without endangering allies.

- 2 Druid: Subclass: Circle of the Spores, Wild Shape, Bone Chill, Speak with Animals

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 introduces the Circle of Stars subclass for Druids (ranged spellcasting; Guiding Bolt; passive 1d6 bonus to attack rolls).
- Circle of Stars excels early (especially with Act 1 gear) but wanes later, with Act 3 highlighting limited late-game scaling.
- Circle of the Moon remains the strongest Druid subclass in BG3; Halsin joins with this subclass already in place.
- You may still need to reroll Halsin because some ability scores, skills, and spell choices may not match recommendations.
