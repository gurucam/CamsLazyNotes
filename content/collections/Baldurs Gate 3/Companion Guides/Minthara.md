## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Channeled Oath Charges
  - Lay on Hands
  - Divine Sense
  - Inquisitor’s Might
  - Oath of Vengeance Tenets
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Inquisitor’s Might for extra damage and swing your sword.
    - Turn 2+: Use Lay on Hands for healing if needed; continue melee attacks.
  - Notes:
    - Move along quickly to level 2 for spell unlocks.
    - Look to replace her starting armor with Heavy Armor after unlocking the Paladin class; look to obtain a two-handed Greatsword.
    - In early levels, the Vengeance Paladin will have dreadful mobility; find and equip a back-bar ranged weapon like a Heavy Crossbow.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Divine Smite
  - Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting
  - Prepared Spells: Searing Smite, Thunderous Smite, Shield of Faith, Divine Favor, Cure Wounds
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Searing Smite
  - Thunderous Smite
  - Shield of Faith
  - Divine Favor
  - Cure Wounds
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Shield of Faith or Divine Favor prior to a fight (bonus action) when helpful.
    - Turn 2+: Attack in melee; use Divine Smite carefully to avoid burning spell slots too quickly.
  - Notes:
    - Be cautious about using Divine Smite too often at this low level; you will burn through spell slots quickly.
    - Don’t waste spell slots on a target with low health; just melee attack them.
    - Divine Smite can proc in combination with Searing Smite (and can consume two spell slots on a critical strike).

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Divine Health
  - Abjure Enemy
  - Vow of Enmity
  - Receives Bane (subclass)
  - Receives Hunter’s Mark (subclass)
  - Prepared Spell: Command
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Searing Smite
  - Thunderous Smite
  - Shield of Faith
  - Divine Favour
  - Cure Wounds
  - Command
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Buff with Divine Favour or Shield of Faith, then attack in melee.
    - Turn 2+: Use Command if you need a stun; use Searing Smite for burst damage; use Thunderous Smite if you need high damage and a single target stun; use Hunter’s Mark as a bonus action if your concentration spell falls off.
  - Notes:
    - At this level, Searing/Thunderous Smite consume both action and bonus action and can be very costly.
    - Keep it simple: buff turn one, burst damage turn two, then evaluate what your group needs (crowd control, burst, healing, etc.).

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Strength)
  - Prepared Spell: Protection from Evil and Good
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Searing Smite
  - Thunderous Smite
  - Shield of Faith
  - Divine Favour
  - Cure Wounds
  - Command
  - Protection from Evil and Good
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Buff with Divine Favour or Shield of Faith as needed, then engage in melee.
    - Turn 2+: Continue melee attacks; use Smite and spell slots when needed for burst.
  - Notes:
    - Simply increasing Strength to 18 is the simplest and easiest way to advance your character.
    - Protection from Evil and Good is a niche spell and is not used often; consider it a flex.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Extra Attack
  - Subclass Spells: Hold Person, Misty Step
  - Extra Prepared Spell: Branding Smite
  - Additional spell slots (Level 1 and Level 2)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):

  - Shield of Faith
  - Divine Favour
  - Cure Wounds
  - Command
  - Protection from Evil and Good
  - Branding Smite
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Misty Step (bonus action) for mobility if needed; otherwise buff/debuff with a bonus action.
    - Turn 2+: Use Extra Attack (two attacks) and Divine Smite reactions as appropriate; use Branding Smite for hard-hitting radiant damage and to prevent targets from turning Invisible.
  - Notes:
    - Misty Step dramatically improves power and mobility because it uses a bonus action.
    - At this point, the issue is spell slots and using Divine Smite reaction appropriately; take Long Rests frequently.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Aura of Protection (must be activated)
  - Prepared Spell: Magic Weapon
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Searing Smite
  - Thunderous Smite
  - Shield of Faith
  - Divine Favour
  - Cure Wounds
  - Command
  - Protection from Evil and Good
  - Branding Smite
  - Magic Weapon
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Buff/debuff as needed.
    - Turn 2+: Continue melee pressure with Extra Attack; use Smite as needed.
  - Notes:
    - Magic Weapon is a decent buff but comes at the cost of a high-level spell slot and concentration.
    - Around level 6, you should be nearly finished with Act 1 content; check merchants and stock up on camp and alchemy supplies.

### Level 7

  - Branding Smite
  - Magic Weapon
  - Lesser Restoration
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Buff/debuff as needed; engage with melee.
    - Turn 2+: Continue melee pressure; use utility spells in rare circumstances.
  - Notes:
    - Lesser Restoration is used in rare circumstances, but can be critical when an ally is paralyzed.

- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Searing Smite
  - Thunderous Smite
  - Shield of Faith
  - Divine Favour
  - Cure Wounds
  - Command
  - Protection from Evil and Good
  - Branding Smite

    - Turn 2+: Action One Attack (proc Divine Smite) goal kill target or critical strike; Action Two Attack (proc Divine Smite) goal kill target or critical strike; then proc Great Weapon Master from kill or critical hit and use bonus action for another attack (proc Divine Smite).
  - Notes:
    - Great Weapon Master’s -5 attack roll penalty / +10 damage can be turned off in the Passive section on your toolbar.
    - Buff with bonus action on the first turn, and use primary melee attacks on the second with the goal of proc Great Weapon Master.
    - Potion of Speed or Haste can add an additional action for even more attacks.

  - Branding Smite
  - Magic Weapon
  - Lesser Restoration
  - Blinding Smite
  - Elemental Weapon
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Keep things simple with Smite damage; use utility only when needed.
    - Turn 2+: Use Blinding Smite as a “big nuke” for +3d8 radiant damage and a possible Blind; use Elemental Weapon if you can pre-buff before a fight.
  - Notes:
    - Haste is one of the best spells in the game because it increases actions; the downside is it takes an action and a level 3 spell slot (the guide prefers Potion of Speed for the same effect for fewer turns).
    - Note on prepared spells: drop Compelled Duel so you can pick up two level 3 spells.

    - Turn 2+: Use burst damage and utility as needed.
  - Notes:
    - Aura of Courage prevents you and nearby allies from being Frightened (aura disappears if you fall Unconscious).
    - Revivify can be useful for long range to bring someone back.

  - Revivify
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue Paladin setup; rely on melee pressure.
    - Turn 2+: Use Second Wind as a mediocre heal when useful.
  - Notes:

## Alternative Build Route
Investing a couple of levels into the Warlock class first will give Minthara access to the powerful Booming Blade cantrip. Then, once you reach level 3, swap back to her usual Paladin class and pick up the Vengeance subclass. With five levels of investment, you will have much more movement speed and melee potential. Finally, at Level 9, you’ll switch to the Fighter and Eldritch Knight subclass for even more spellcasting and melee damage potential.

Level | Class | Selection
--- | --- | ---
1 | Warlock | Hexblade, Shield, Hellish Rebuke, Booming Blade, Eldritch Blast
2 | Warlock | Wrathful Smite, Hex spells, One with Shadows, Devil’s Sight Invocations
3 | Paladin | Multiclass Paladin, Vengeance Subclass
4 | Paladin | Great Weapon Fighting, Command, Thunderous Smite, Divine Favour, Shield of Faith, Cure Wounds
5 | Paladin | Protection from Good and Evil
6 | Paladin | Great Weapon Master Feat, Compelled Duel
7 | Paladin | Drop Compelled, select Magic Weapon, Lesser Restoration
8 | Paladin | Aid spell
9 | Fighter | Multiclass Fighter, Defense Fighting Style
10 | Fighter | Action Surge
11 | Fighter | Eldritch Knight subclass, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile spells, Bursting Sinew, Fire Bolt cantrips, Longstrider extended
12 | Fighter | Savage Attacker feat, Shield spell

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- The most significant updates to the Minthara Paladin build in Patch 8 stem from the introduction of new subclasses, spells, and cantrips.
- While the core combat strategy remains largely unchanged, these additions open the door to powerful new multiclassing options that enhance both versatility and damage potential.
- The Booming Blade cantrip now offers a better advantage by adding thunder damage to each attack, making it a strong option (especially true when multiclassing into Hexblade Warlock, Sorcerer, or Wizard).
