## Build snapshot

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Deploy Minthara as a heavy-armored frontline enforcer: close distance, control priority targets, and convert limited resources into burst melee pressure.**

### About companion
- Minthara is a **Paladin (Oath of Vengeance)** companion built to **initiate fights in melee**, wear **heavy armour**, and deliver **high single-target burst** while staying durable.
- She plays best with a **two-handed Greatsword** and a “pick one target, delete it” approach, using utility and control only when it matters.
- Treat her as a **tool you deploy to start and stabilize fights**: step into danger first, force trades on your terms, and keep enemies pinned so the party can execute.

### Party role
- **Frontline initiator:** takes first contact and forces melee engagement in heavy armour.
- **Single-target burst:** spends limited resources to remove hard targets when needed.
- **Support utility:** carries situational recovery/cleanse tools for emergencies.

### Pros
- Crowd Control
- High Burst Damage
- Heavy Armour

### Cons
- Spell Slot Starved
- Limited Spells
- Heavy Armour Complex

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Vow of Enmity** (advantage pressure tool) + subclass spell access (as presented in source)
- Level 5: **Extra Attack** (two attacks per action; more chances to convert resources into burst)
- Level 6: **Aura of Protection** (saving throw support aura)
- Level 8: **Great Weapon Master** (bonus attack on kill/crit + high-risk damage toggle)
- Level 9: big “nuke” upgrade via higher-tier options (as presented in source)
- Level 12: **Action Surge** (extra action once per fight)

## Level-by-level progression (Paladin 1 → 10, Fighter 11 → 12)
> Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop for deploying Minthara effectively.

### Level 1 — Paladin 1
**Gain**
- **Lay on Hands**
- **Divine Sense**
- **Inquisitor’s Might**
- **Channeled Oath Charges** (resource as presented in source)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Use Minthara as a **melee opener**: get her into contact early, and rely on **heavy armour upgrades** and a **two-handed Greatsword** plan as soon as possible.
- Treat **Lay on Hands** as your “keep the frontline standing” button: stabilize Minthara or a teammate when the turn matters.

### Level 2 — Paladin 2
**Gain**
- **Searing Smite**
- **Thunderous Smite**
- **Shield of Faith**
- **Divine Favor**
- **Cure Wounds**

**Play style (Level 2)**
- You’re now resource-limited: use spell slots **wisely** and don’t burn them all early unless the fight demands it.
- Lean on the kit for **damage + control** when needed, but keep the main plan simple: **stay in melee and trade efficiently**.

### Level 3 — Paladin 3 (Oath of Vengeance)
**Gain**
- **Vow of Enmity**
- **Receives Bane** (as presented in source)
- **Receives Hunter’s Mark** (as presented in source)
- **Command**

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Use **Vow of Enmity** to create consistent pressure on the highest-value target when you need reliability.
- Keep your loop focused: **pick one enemy, commit, and don’t spread your limited resources too thin**.

### Level 4 — Paladin 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: Strength**

**Gain**
- **Protection from Evil and Good**

**Play style (Level 4)**
- This is mostly a numbers bump: stronger melee presence and more consistent frontline performance.
- Use protection utility when the situation calls for it, but keep Minthara doing her job: **frontline contact and target removal**.

### Level 5 — Paladin 5
**Gain**
- **Extra Attack**
- **Hold Person**
- **Misty Step**
- **Branding Smite**

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Extra Attack is a major jump: you now get **two attacks per action**, increasing both damage and the number of chances to spend resources effectively.
- Use **Misty Step** for **mobility** (bonus action) to close gaps and stay on priority targets; combine mobility + pressure to keep fights under control.
- Manage the build’s biggest pain point here: **spell slots**. Take **Long Rests frequently** and don’t wander into new encounters with empty resources.

### Level 6 — Paladin 6
**Gain**
- **Aura of Protection**
- **Magic Weapon**

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Once you unlock **Aura of Protection**, **activate it** so you and nearby allies gain the saving throw bonus (as presented in source).
- Gameplay otherwise stays steady: **frontline contact + selective resource spend**, with Aura providing passive value.
- Around this point you may be wrapping Act 1: check merchants, stock supplies, and consider key craftables (as presented in source).

### Level 7 — Paladin 7
**Gain**
- **Relentless Avenger** (subclass feature as presented in source)
- Additional higher-tier slot access (as presented in source)
- **Lesser Restoration**

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Not much changes; this level is largely a bridge to the next power jump.
- Keep the plan disciplined: **stay in melee, stabilize when needed, and conserve resources for the fights that matter**.

### Level 8 — Paladin 8
**Feat**
- **Great Weapon Master**

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Great Weapon Master has two parts: a **high-risk damage toggle** (more damage but reduced accuracy), and the key payoff: a **bonus action attack on kill/critical**.
- Initiate combat with your **action first**, saving your **bonus action** for the Great Weapon Master follow-up attack when you score a kill/crit (as presented in source).
- If your hit chance drops too low, **turn the toggle off** in the Passive section and focus on reliable hits (as presented in source).

### Level 9 — Paladin 9
**Gain**
- **Haste**
- **Protection from Energy**
- **Blinding Smite**
- **Elemental Weapon**

**Play style (Level 9)**
- You have more options, but most are **niche**: your bread-and-butter remains **melee burst** (as presented in source).
- **Blinding Smite** is positioned as your big “nuke” tool at this level; keep the overall plan simple and only spend utility when needed (as presented in source).
- Note on prepared spells (as presented in source): **drop Compelled Duel** so you can pick up two level 3 spells.

### Level 10 — Paladin 10
**Gain**
- **Aura of Courage**
- **Revivify**
- Additional Lay on Hands charge (as presented in source)

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Gameplay remains largely unchanged: you gain more utility, with **Aura of Courage** preventing fear on you and nearby allies (as presented in source).
- **Revivify** is situational but can matter when you need a long-range recovery option (as presented in source).

### Level 11 — Fighter 1
**Gain**
- **Defence Fighting Style**
- **Second Wind**

**Play style (Level 11)**
- This level can feel uneventful, but it sets up the endgame spike (as presented in source).
- Defence Fighting Style is passive survivability; Second Wind is a bonus-action heal but many potions outperform it (as presented in source).

### Level 12 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- **Action Surge**

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Action Surge gives you an **extra action once per fight** without requiring a resource pool (as presented in source).
- The core payoff is stacking actions with Extra Attack: you can convert one turn into a large burst sequence, and extend it further with additional speed/extra-action effects (as presented in source).
- If you want a traditional Paladin route instead of this multiclass end, the source notes other feat options (as presented in source).
