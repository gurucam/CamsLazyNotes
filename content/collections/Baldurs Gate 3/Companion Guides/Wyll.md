## Build snapshot

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Deploy Wyll as a ranged spell artillery piece: apply pressure with repeatable cantrip damage, control space with selective spell use, and sustain momentum through short rests.**

### About companion
- Wyll is a **Warlock (Fiend)** companion focused on **ranged spell pressure**, primarily using a reliable cantrip loop supported by limited but powerful spell slots.
- He excels when positioned **behind the frontline**, leveraging terrain and distance to avoid focus while contributing steady damage and control.
- Treat Wyll as a **resource-efficient caster**: he thrives on repeated encounters with short rests rather than long, drawn-out attrition.

### Party role
- **Ranged damage dealer:** consistent output from cantrips without draining long-rest resources.
- **Spell control:** access to situational crowd control and area damage when needed.
- **Flexible utility:** reactions and defensive spells to punish enemies that reach him.

### Pros
- Strong repeatable ranged damage
- Short-rest spell slot recovery
- Solid defensive reactions and positioning tools

### Cons
- Limited spell slots per fight
- Requires positioning discipline
- Less effective when forced into melee

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Agonizing Blast** (major cantrip damage increase)
- Level 5: **Fireball** (area damage option)
- Level 7: **Banishment** (single-target control)
- Level 10: **Fiendish Resilience** (selectable damage resistance)
- Level 11: **Mystic Arcanum** (high-impact spell without slot cost)
