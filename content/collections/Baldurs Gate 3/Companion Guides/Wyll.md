## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Known as the Blade of Frontiers, Wyll carved a reputation as a living legend and esteemed human noble, while concealing an ominous pact.
- His formidable might emanates from a Demonic patron.
- Encounters with him unfold early in the game, when he valiantly joins the battle to safeguard Druid Grove.

- Durable spellcaster with defensive tools and temporary hit points upon kills.

### Pros
- Short Rest Recovery
- Best Cantrip
- High Durability

### Cons
- Weak Range
- Slow Start
- Spellcaster Lacks Spells

### Power Spikes

    - Turn 2+: Eldritch Blast repeatedly; save spell slots for Hellish Rebuke (reaction)
  - Notes:
    - Use clothing (no armor) and a Quarterstaff, but mainly rely on ranged damage and not play in melee.
    - As a Human, equip a shield in conjunction with a Quarterstaff for immediate +2 AC.
    - For Hellish Rebuke: hit the passives tab on your character’s menu and request “ask” so it doesn’t automatically trigger on low-health targets.

    - Turn 2+: Eldritch Blast; use Hellish Rebuke as a reaction; use Armour of Agathys for survivability early
  - Notes:

## Subclass Options
### Warlock Subclasses
- Archfey: grants Warlock access to spells and abilities that manipulate emotions, charm enemies, and harness the power of nature.
- Fiend: a powerful ranged attacker that deals fire damage and extra temporary hit points whenever they kill an enemy.
- Great Old One: This subclass is a versatile spellcaster that can deal both psychic and necrotic damage.

### The Fiend Warlock Subclass Progression
- Dark One’s Blessing (Level 1): When you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, this gift from your patron grants you Charisma Modifier + Level hit points.
- Dark One’s Own Luck (Level 6): Call on your patron to change your fate and add a 1d10 to an Ability Check once per Short Rest.
- Fiendish Resilience (Level 10): Choose a damage type and become resistant to it. You can pick a new damage type for each Short Rest.

## Best Consumables
- Elixir of Bloodlust: Once per turn when you kill a foe, you gain HP 5 temporary hit points and an additional action.
- Potion of Speed: Gain extra action, +2 AC, Advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws, and double movement speed.
- Potion of Invisibility: Become invisible for 1 minute. Attacking or casting spells ends the status.
- Potion of Flying: 10 turns of flying.

## Permanent Bonuses
### Act 1

### Act 2

### Act 3

## Illithid Powers

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Eldritch Blast: Eldritch Blast is your bread-and-butter cantrip and should be cast in conjunction with Hex which is a bonus action for optimal damage.
- Short Rests: Utilize short rests to recover spell slots and replenish your resources, as Warlocks regain their spell slots on short rest.
- Ranged Advantage: As a ranged spellcaster, maintain distance from enemies to reduce the likelihood of taking damage.
- High Ground: When you attack from above, you gain a +2 bonus to the Attack Roll so always look to go up!
- Crowd Control: Use spells like Hold Person and Hypnotic Pattern to control groups of enemies and turn the tide of battles or have companions cast similar spells.
- Avoiding Friendly Fire: Be cautious with area-of-effect spells to avoid hitting your party members.
- Use Consumables: Potion of Speed gives you an additional action and can be found during the tutorial.
- Misty Step: save a level 2 spell in case you need to retreat via Misty Step.
- Spell Slots: Save spell slots for Hellish Rebuke which reacts when taking damage without costing an action.
- Mirror Image: Cast this immediately when taking melee pressure for survivability.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative take: begin by choosing the Hexblade subclass (immediate access to better weapon and armor proficiencies) for a more melee-focused approach.
- Note in the guide: any Warlock can still select the Booming Blade cantrip at Level 1 and pick up Shadow Blade by Level 3; if you prefer The Fiend subclass for its damage buffs and survivability perks, it’s still a solid choice, but without Hexblade or a dip into another class you’ll be more limited in your gear options, especially for frontline combat.
- At Level 7, this build branches into a multiclass with Oath of Vengeance Paladin, boosting durability with Heavy Armor proficiency and ramping up melee potential; Paladins pair especially well with Booming Blade; without proficiency, Booming Blade’s bonus damage won’t activate.

Alternative Level Progression (as listed):
- Level 1: Warlock — Subclass: Hexblade, Eldritch Blast, Booming Blade, Hex, Wrathful Smite
- Level 2: Warlock — Hellish Rebuke, Eldritch Invocations: Devil’s Sight and One with Shadows
- Level 3: Warlock — Shadow Blade, Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain
- Level 4: Warlock — Mage Hand, Darkness, Feat: Ability Improvement Charisma +2
- Level 5: Warlock — Counterspell, Eldritch Invocations: Repelling Blast
- Level 6: Warlock — Misty Step
- Level 7: Paladin — Subclass: Oath of Vengeance, Armor/Weapon Proficiencies
- Level 8: Paladin — Defence Fighting Style, Command, Thunderous Smite, Divine Favour, Searing Smite, Shield, Cure Wounds
- Level 9: Paladin — Protection from Good and Evil
- Level 10: Paladin — Compelled Duel, Feat: Alert
- Level 11: Paladin — Magic Weapon
- Level 12: Paladin — Protection from Poison

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 of Baldur’s Gate 3 marked a turning point for the Warlock class, introducing the Hexblade subclass and the Booming Blade cantrip.
- These tools elevate Warlocks into true hybrid powerhouses with a synergy enabling a fluid mix of spellcasting and melee combat.
- These updates also pave the way for innovative build paths, including a multiclass combination with the Paladin described in the alternate Level Progression section.

### Patch 7
- Wyll only received minor bug fixes and dialogue additions in Patch 7 of BG3; Wyll’s Warlock build, combat, and gameplay elements remained untouched.
- The patch added a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager, allowing players to create and install mods directly within the game.
