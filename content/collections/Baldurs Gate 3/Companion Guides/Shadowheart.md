## Level-by-level progression (Cleric 1 → 12)

### Level 1 — Cleric 1 (Life Domain)
- **Gain:** Class: Cleric (starts as Trickery Domain, guide respecs to Life Domain). Subclass: Life Domain. Heavy Armour Proficiency. Feature: Disciple of Life (Heal Spells gain additional HP equal to 2 + Spell's level).
- **Play style:** Immediately benefit from Heavy Armour for durability. Focus on casting *Bless* for concentration (buffing allies) or using *Guiding Bolt* for high early damage. The *Disciple of Life* feature makes *Cure Wounds* and *Healing Word* more impactful.

### Level 2 — Cleric 2
- **Gain:** Channel Divinity: Preserve Life (Restores HP to allies in a 9m area, no spell slot cost).
- **Play style:** Use Preserve Life as a powerful area-of-effect group heal when needed. This is best used when multiple allies require immediate support and your primary action is spent on a buff.

### Level 3 — Cleric 3
- **Gain:** Level 2 Spell Slots. Domain Spells: *Aid*, *Lesser Restoration*.
- **Play style:** *Aid* is a crucial out-of-combat buff to increase the party’s maximum HP pool. *Spiritual Weapon* is a highly recommended spell at this level for concentration-free sustained damage.

### Level 4 — Cleric 4
- **Gain:** Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Wisdom) (Wis 18 total). New Cantrip.
- **Play style:** Increased Wisdom improves spell attack rolls and the Save DC of your offensive and crowd-control spells. Continue to use bonus actions for *Healing Word* and *Spiritual Weapon*.

### Level 5 — Cleric 5
- **Gain:** Level 3 Spell Slots. Domain Spells: *Revivify*, *Beacon of Hope*. Feature: Destroy Undead (Channel Divinity upgrade).
- **Play style:** Gaining *Revivify* gives the party a critical resurrection tool. *Beacon of Hope* is a strong emergency concentration buff that prevents critical failures on death saves and maximizes healing.

### Level 6 — Cleric 6
- **Gain:** Feature: Blessed Healer (Regain 2 + Spell Level hit points when casting a healing spell on another creature).
- **Play style:** This feature reinforces the primary healer role, allowing Shadowheart to partially self-sustain while actively healing others. Maintain concentration on key spells like *Spirit Guardians* (if selected) or *Bless*.

### Level 7 — Cleric 7
- **Gain:** Level 4 Spell Slots. Domain Spells: *Guardian of Faith*, *Death Ward*.
- **Play style:** *Guardian of Faith* is a powerful, concentration-free summon used to control areas or protect a position for multiple turns. *Death Ward* is an excellent preventative measure for front-line allies.

### Level 8 — Cleric 8
- **Gain:** Feat: War Caster (Recommended for Concentration Save Advantage). Feature: Divine Strike: Life (Once per turn, deal 1d8 Radiant in addition to weapon damage on a melee attack).
- **Play style:** *War Caster* is a crucial defensive feat for a concentration-heavy build, providing a massive increase in reliability for maintaining buffs like *Bless* or *Spirit Guardians*. Divine Strike is a small but useful damage boost for melee attacks.

### Level 9 — Cleric 9
- **Gain:** Level 5 Spell Slots. Domain Spells: *Greater Restoration*, *Mass Cure Wounds*.
- **Play style:** *Mass Cure Wounds* provides the build's most powerful area-of-effect healing, using a full action to stabilize a large number of allies simultaneously.

### Level 10 — Cleric 10
- **Gain:** Feature: Divine Intervention (A single-use power with several strong effects, including a full group heal). New Cantrip.
- **Play style:** Divine Intervention is a powerful emergency button. Continue to focus on maximizing action and bonus action efficiency: Action for primary buffs/control, Bonus Action for *Healing Word* or *Spiritual Weapon*.

### Level 11 — Cleric 11
- **Gain:** Level 6 Spell Slots.
- **Play style:** Access to Level 6 spells like *Heal* and *Planar Ally* (if selected). *Heal* is a massive single-target burst heal for emergencies.

### Level 12 — Cleric 12
- **Gain:** Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Wisdom) (Wis 20 total).
- **Play style:** Finalizing Wisdom to 20 maximizes Spell Save DC, spell attack rolls, and the effectiveness of all healing spells.
