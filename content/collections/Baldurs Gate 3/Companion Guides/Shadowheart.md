## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Shadowheart is a High Half-Elf Cleric Companion in Baldur’s Gate 3 who serves Shar as a Trickery Domain Cleric.
- Depending on the choices you make in your playthrough, her faith and allegiance to Shar can change.
- You’ll have a very obvious lore-supported opportunity to fully respec and rebuild her character before Act 3 if you’re being strict with lore-accurate roleplay.

### Core Playstyle
- Support Cleric focused on exceptional healing and group utility (Life Domain), using buffs, healing, and situational damage spells.

### Party Role
- Great Support Class
- Healer (pins Shadowheart into the healer-bot role somewhat)

### Pros
- Great Support Class
- Proficient in Stealth
- Versatility outside Combat

### Cons
- Complex Playstyle
- Not damage-focused
- May feel particularly weak for AoE damage

### Power Spikes
- At levels 4, 5, 7, and 9, expect big spikes in power.

  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Inflict Wounds
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Shield of Faith
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use a buff like Shield of Faith or Bless (both require concentration, and you can’t use both).
    - Turn 2+: Guiding Bolt at range; Fire Bolt cantrips with low spell slots; Sacred Flame when you don’t have a direct line of sight.
  - Notes:
    - Combine Healing Word (bonus action) + Cure Wounds (action) for two heals in one turn.
    - Spell slots are very limited early; use cantrips for damage without consuming a spell slot.

- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Shield of Faith

  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue using buffs (Bless / Shield of Faith as concentration).
    - Turn 2+: Use Command for crowd control; Preserve Life as a massive area-based heal (no spell slot).
  - Notes:
    - Preserve Life restores (3*Cleric Level) hit points to allied creatures (does not affect undead and constructs).
    - Command can force weapons to drop or put enemies in prone.

  - Domain Spells: Aid, Lesser Restoration
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Shield of Faith
  - Healing Word
  - Command
  - Inflict Wounds
  - Spiritual Weapon

    - Turn 2+: Continue damage/healing priorities; pre-cast Spiritual Weapon before combat if you know an encounter is about to unfold.
  - Notes:
    - Spiritual Weapon doesn’t cost concentration and can be used in conjunction with action spells.
    - Inflict Wounds is described as a flex spell (can be dropped for something else like Sanctuary if you do not use it).

  - Cantrip: Blade Ward
  - Spell: Warding Bond
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Healing Word
  - Inflict Wounds
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Shield of Faith
  - Command
  - Spiritual Weapon
  - Warding Bond
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Pre-cast Warding Bond outside combat (lasts until a long rest) when useful; maintain concentration buffs as needed.
    - Turn 2+: Continue Guiding Bolt / healing as needed.
  - Notes:
    - Warding Bond: target gains +1 AC, +1 saving throws, and resistance to all damage, but the caster shares damage.
    - Sanctuary and Hold Person are listed as alternative options at this level.

### Level 5

  - Shield of Faith
  - Healing Word
  - Command
  - Inflict Wounds
  - Spiritual Weapon
  - Warding Bond
  - Hold Person
  - Mass Healing Word
  - Glyph of Warding
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Mass Healing Word (bonus action) + action-based spell/heal in the same turn.
    - Turn 2+: Use Beacon of Hope as concentration when you expect heavy damage and you won’t be doing anything but healing each turn.
  - Notes:
    - Mass Healing Word is an upgraded version of Healing Word: heal up to 6 creatures with a bonus action.
    - Glyph of Warding is mentioned as an option if you want more offensive pressure; Animate Dead is noted as helpful but can go against Shadowheart’s lore background.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Class Features: another Channel Divinity Charge; Blessed Healer
  - Spell: Glyph of Warding
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Shield of Faith

  - Spiritual Weapon
  - Warding Bond

- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Summon Spiritual Weapon (bonus action); cast Bless before combat or on first turn.
    - Turn 2+: Use Guiding Bolt or Glyph of Warding for damage; Mass Healing Word + Preserve Life for big healing.
  - Notes:
    - Blessed Healer: when you cast a healing spell of Level 1 or higher on another creature, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level.
    - Ending Act 1 notes: don’t forget the legendary weapon Blood of Lathander; heavy Adamantine Armour is described as incredible and can last until Act 3.

- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Drop Guardian of Faith (action) + Spiritual Weapon (bonus action) on the same turn (both do not require concentration).
    - Turn 2+: Priority mode emphasizing healing and buffs with Bless; use Glyph of Warding for area damage and Guiding Bolt for single target when everyone is high on health.
  - Notes:
    - Death Ward is noted as handy for difficult boss fights where you assume someone will get one shot.
    - If you feel you lack crowd control, Freedom of Movement can be swapped out for Banishment (single-target CC).

    - Turn 2+: Continue support priorities; Divine Strike is described as not a priority for this support build.
  - Notes:
    - War Caster: Advantage on Saving Throws to maintain Concentration; reaction to cast Shocking Grasp at a target moving out of melee range.

  - Flame Strike
- Play Style:

    - Turn 2+: Use Insect Plague for massive area damage and movement hindrance (requires concentration) or Flame Strike for harder-hitting area damage without concentration.
  - Notes:
    - Gameplay: “much better area-based healing and damage” and “a big leap in power.”
    - Multi-Class Options are discussed at this level (Fighter two levels; Rogue four levels; Cleric 12 preferred for level 5 and 6 spells and another feat).

    - Turn 2+: Save Divine Intervention for the final fight of the game where damage is critical (as suggested).
  - Notes:
    - Divine Intervention: once used, can never be used again; “the obvious one is a damage spell” (massive area and huge damage).
    - “Cheese” option described: hire a hireling, respec to Life Cleric, cast the version that gives a free legendary mace, equip Shadowheart with it, dismiss the companion.

### Level 11

## Features and Mechanics
- Patch 8 update: addition of the Booming Blade cantrip; this new option benefits melee builds, with the recently added Death Domain Cleric getting the most out of it.
- Recent buffs to monsters have made Tactician and Honour Modes slightly more difficult.
- Shadowheart Features & Mechanics:
  - Class: Cleric
  - Race: High Half-Elf
  - Background: Urchin
  - Subclass: Default Trickery, Reroll to Life Domain
  - Base Proficiencies: Sleight of Hand, Stealth, Religion, Insight
  - Best Build: Cleric, Life Domain, Heavy Armor
  - Origin Character: Yes
  - Romance: Yes
  - Location: On the beach next to the Abandoned Ruins, Act 1
- Companion respec notes:
  - Your companion can be respecced or rerolled early in the game: change class, subclass, ability score, and more.
  - The only feature that cannot be adjusted is their race and story.
  - Suggest using Withers at Camp after he’s unlocked to optimize the build.
- Cleric Spell Mechanics:
  - Cantrips: Like spells, but you can cast them infinitely, and they don’t take your spell slots.
  - Spell Slots: finite number of spells until a long rest; higher levels give more usage and high-tier spells.
  - Learn Spells: opportunities at leveling up to unlearn and learn new spells.
  - Concentration: requires you to maintain concentration; otherwise, the spell effect ends.
- Shadowheart Weakness:
  - Lack of initiative due to lower Dexterity and movement speed.
  - Misty Step is recommended as a solution; an Amulet provides free use of Misty Step once per short rest; also be on the lookout for traders for scrolls of this and stock up.
  - Lack of bonus action utility; bonus action later for Spiritual Weapon, Misty Step, and Healing Word.
  - Elixirs last until a long rest; early fire resistance and later Elixir of Universal Resistance are mentioned.
- Early Priorities:
  - Upgrade armor to heavy +1
  - Upgrading shield to uncommon
  - This should get you to 17 or 18 AC
  - Stocking up on scrolls of Misty Step
  - Stock up on camping supplies for a long rest
  - Buy every crafting material from vendors
  - Acquire Amulet of Misty Step

## Subclass Options
### Cleric Subclasses
- Knowledge Domain: Dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and skilled in history, religion, and the arcana.
- Life Domain: Skilled in the use of healing spells, and they can also use their divine power to restore hit points to their allies.
- Light Domain: Skilled in radiant damage and more offensive Cleric subclass.
- Nature Domain: Skilled in the use of nature’s spells, and they can also use their divine power to control the weather and animals.
- Tempest Domain: Skilled in the use of lightning and thunder damage spells, and they can also use their divine power to control the weather and create powerful storms.
- Trickery Domain: Skilled in the use of illusion and enchantment spells, and they can also use their divine power to create illusions and disguise themselves.
- War Domain: Skilled in the use of weapons and armor, and they can also use their divine power to enhance their martial prowess.
- Death Domain: Added in BG3 patch 8, this Cleric Domain specializes in Necrotic damage (sort of a foil to Life Domain).

### Life Domain Cleric Features & Progression
- Disciple of Life (Level 1): Your devotion empowers your healing Spells. When casting a healing spell, the target regains additional Hit Points equal to 2 + Spell’s level.
- Heavy Armour Proficiency (Level 1)
- Domain Spells (Level 1): Bless and Cure Wounds
- Channel Divinity Action (Level 2): Preserve Life
- Domain Spells (Level 3): Aid and Lesser Restoration
- Domain Spells (Level 5): Revivify and Beacon of Hope

- Domain Spells (Level 9): Greater Restoration and Mass Cure Wounds

### Story Choice Build-Affecting Changes
- Nightsong choice at the end of Act 2 can significantly affect her build.
- Slaying the Nightsong: Shadowheart becomes Shar’s Dark Justiciar and receives:
  - Dark Justiciar Half-Plate (Very Rare): Medium Armour, AC 17
    - Shar’s Aegis: Level 1 Concentration spell (Bonus Action) increases AC by 2 until Long Rest; reduces incoming damage by 2; deals 1d4 Necrotic damage to the attacker
    - Advantage on Constitution Saving throws and Stealth checks
  - Dark Justiciar Gauntlets:
    - Beckoning Darkness: Level 4 spell that curses the target to take 2d8 Necrotic damage every turn if they are in a lightly or heavily obscured area; Bonus Action; lasts 2 turns
    - Umbral Attack: Weapon attacks deal additional 1d4 Necrotic Damage
    - Strength Saving throw saving throws +1
  - Dark Justiciar Boots:
    - Shadow Teleportation: Teleport to an obscured spot
    - Dexterity Saving throw saving throws +1
  - Shar’s Spear of Evening:
    - Shar’s Darkness: Cast Darkness using an Action. Recharges every turn
    - Blind Immunity
    - Shar’s Blessing: Advantage on Saving throws while lightly or heavily obscured
- Sparing the Nightsong:
  - Moonlight Glaive: Enchantment +2; passively shines a light around it
  - Selûne’s Spear of Night: Enchantment +3; Moonbeam; Darkvision
- Which Choice Effects the Build:
  - Slaying the Nightsong is described as a more significant choice from a build-creation perspective.
  - The gear allows a playstyle centered around casting Darkness with Selûne’s Spear of Night and using heavily obscured bonuses to gain advantage on Blinded opponents.
  - If you choose to use Shar’s equipment, you may want to respec Shadowheart to the Death Domain subclass to get Inescapable Destruction, which lets Necrotic damage ignore resistances to it.
  - This playstyle can be especially potent if you have a party member with Devil’s Sight to see through the magical darkness.

## Best Consumables
- Potion of Greater Healing: 8d4 + 8 healing and removes burning.
- Potion of Invisibility: Become invisible for 1 minute. Attacking or casting spells ends the status.
- Potion of Flying: 10 turns of flying.
- Potion of Speed: 3 turns of an increased action via the Haste condition.
- Potion of Angelic Slumber: fall asleep for two turns, then restore all spell slots, hit points, and abilities.

## Permanent Bonuses
### Act 1

### Act 2

### Act 3

## Illithid Powers

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Heal Allies: Focus on healing allies vs doing damage, so your heavy hitters can spend actions and bonus actions doing damage.
- Bonus Action Heal: Make the most of your bonus action heal in conjunction with a primary action-based heal.
- Blessed: Cast Bless outside of combat before engaging and get a lot of turns without having to use a turn in combat.
- Crowd Control: CC opponents with Blind and Command to take less damage overall.
- Cantrips: Use these when lacking spell slots or when you’re not committed to a major offensive spell to keep some spell slots in reserve.
- Guiding Bolt: Early on, this is your big nuke spell, and it’s wise to use it on the first turn when teammates don’t need a heal.
- Area vs Single Target: Make sure to get the most out of each spell, and if you need multiple players healed, get in position and use an area-based heal.
- Consumables: Take advantage of a potion of speed when you need multiple actions per turn.
- Health Potions: Make sure teammates are stocked up on healing potions in case they are out of your line of sight or need massive healing themselves.
- Range: Make sure to hang out at medium range where you can melee heal or do damage, but not too far back to the line of sight of your teammates.

## Alternative Build Route
- Trickery Domain / Rogue split is stated as working wonderfully as a Tactician-viable BG3 build (with a recommendation to redo Ability Scores).
- Fighter/Cleric Multiclass Shadowheart:
  - Focuses on debuffing enemies with Radiating Orb via Luminous Armour.
  - You can obtain this gear in Act 1 and use it throughout the game while maintaining decent damage with Spirit Guardians.
  - Recommended if you struggle with survival in tough fights.
  - Level Progression (as listed):
    - Level 1 Cleric: Subclass Light; Thaumaturgy, Guidance, Sacred Flame; Command, Guiding Bolt, Sanctuary, Healing Word
    - Level 2 Cleric: Shield of Faith
    - Level 3 Cleric: Spiritual Weapon

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- The Cleric’s most notable update with Patch 8 in BG3 comes with the addition of the Booming Blade cantrip.
- The recently added Death Domain Cleric gets the most out of Booming Blade.
- Recent buffs to monsters have made Tactician and Honour Modes slightly more difficult.

### Patch 7
- Expect little changes to Shadowheart in Patch 7 of BG3, as only minor bug fixes and cinematics changes impact Shadowheart.
- On September 5th, 2024, Patch 7 for Baldur’s Gate 3 was released: 13 new cinematic scenes (including new battle sequences with the Netherbrain).
- Honour Mode enhancements with more legendary actions added to existing bosses.
- Main focus in this patch is mods: modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager allowing players to create and install mods directly within the game.
- Therefore, as it stands, the best Shadowheart build guide remains intact.
