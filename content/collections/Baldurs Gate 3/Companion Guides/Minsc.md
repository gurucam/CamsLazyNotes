## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Favoured Enemy: Bounty Hunter
  - Natural Explorer: Beast Tamer
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Take Bounty Hunter: Favoured Enemy. Creatures you hit with Ensnaring Strike (either Ranged or Melee) have a Disadvantage on their Saving Throw.
    - Take Beast Tamer as your Natural Explorer. You can cast a Find Familiar conjuration spell.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Fighting Style: Archery
  - Spells: Hunter’s Mark, Cure Wounds
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Take Archery to get a +2 to-hit chance when using Bows and Crossbows.
    - Hunter’s Mark can be cast with a bonus action rather than an action.
    - Other spells at this point cost actions and bonus actions or concentration which we will use for Hunter’s Mark.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Gloom Stalker
  - Dread Ambusher
  - Superior Darkvision
  - Umbral Shroud
  - Dread Ambusher: Hide
  - Disguise Self
  - Spell: Ensnaring Strike (ranged)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Find Familiar
  - Cure Wounds
  - Hunter’s Mark
  - Ensnaring Strike (Range)
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - The biggest is using Dread Ambusher and Umbral Shroud to conceal yourself.
    - Your goal with this build is to proc the Surprised status effect by attacking from stealth first, then eliminating the primary target.
    - Ensnaring Strike (ranged) is a “lockdown” ability when you are getting pressured; it uses an action and bonus action and requires concentration.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Feat: Sharpshooter
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Sharpshooter ignores High Ground rules, and gives +10 damage but -5 to attack roll.
    - Gameplay remains starting from stealth, opening up as the attacker, using Hunter’s Mark and your main bow attack.
    - Use Ensnaring Strike when needed as crowd control.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Extra Attack
  - Spell: Spiked Growth
  - Misty Step (free spell)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Find Familiar
  - Cure Wounds
  - Hunter’s Mark
  - Ensnaring Strike (Range)
  - Spiked Growth
  - Misty Step
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Gameplay becomes about applying Hunter’s Mark with your bonus action and then striking for two turns due to Extra Attack.
    - You can also use various elemental arrows for stuns, damage overtimes, and more.
    - Cast additional spells when you need to prevent a target from reaching you.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Favoured Enemy: Ranger Knight (Gain History and heavy armour proficiency)
  - Natural Explorer: Wasteland Wanderer: Cold (gain cold resistance)
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - These aren’t that important, and mainly add skill proficiency or a cantrip you are most likely not to use.
    - Gameplay and spells remain the same at this level.

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Spell: Lesser Restoration
  - Iron Mind (Proficiency in Wisdom and Intelligence Saving Throws)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Find Familiar
  - Cure Wounds
  - Hunter’s Mark
  - Ensnaring Strike (Range)
  - Spiked Growth
  - Lesser Restoration
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - We recommend going with Lesser Restoration.

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Land’s Stride
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Dexterity to 18)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Find Familiar
  - Cure Wounds
  - Hunter’s Mark
  - Ensnaring Strike (Range)
  - Spiked Growth
  - Lesser Restoration
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - The gameplay remains unchanged, use multi-attack, hunter’s mark and cast spells to crowd control targets.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Subclass Spell: Fear
  - Spells: Lightning Arrow, Stoneskin (replace Lesser Restoration)
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Fear isn’t that useful of a skill unless you are trying to either run away or lock down a group in an area; it requires an action and concentration.
    - Lightning Arrow is very high damage, but it’s in melee range; you can use this as a bonus action and keep your action.
    - Stoneskin lasts until a long rest and requires concentration; this is ideal when you 100% know you are going into a high-damage situation and need survival.
    - Many skills require concentration and you can only have one active; experiment for more damage or survivability.

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Hide in Plain Sight (Class Feature)
  - Favoured Enemy: Mage Breaker (Arcana proficiency and can cast True Strike)
  - Natural Explorer: Urban Tracker (Proficiency in Sleight of Hand)
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Use Hide in Plain Sight before combat and unload during turn one, or use it for out-of-combat sneaking and stealing.
    - Mage Breaker is somewhat useful for getting True Strike cantrip; you can flex it out for skill proficiency of your choice.
    - Urban Tracker helps the class utility by gaining Sleight of Hand without using a Rogue.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Stalker’s Flurry (Subclass Feature)
  - Spell: Conjure Barrage
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Stalker’s Flurry: When you miss a weapon attack, you can make another weapon attack for free.
    - Conjure Barrage helps because we lack any type of area damage, and it doesn’t require concentration.
    - You can combo Conjure Barrage with Lightning Arrow because Lightning Arrow is a bonus action spell.

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Dexterity to 20)
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - At this level, you will have a lot of damage, spells, utility and even crowd control.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Mobility: Rangers are very mobile, so use this to your advantage in combat. Use high movement offensively and defensively to position for better attacks and to get out of danger.
- Stealth: Use stealth to sneak up on enemies and get the drop on them; especially useful in boss fights to deal damage before the enemy knows you’re there.
- Spell Timing: Use spells wisely to buff allies, debuff enemies, and deal damage, but know they are limited and should be used when needed most.
- Prepare: Recharge spells with Long Rest; always have potions, elemental arrows, and Speed Potions ready.
- Environment: If overwhelmed, Dash to create more movement, line of sight of the enemy, and get in stealth to lose aggro and hopefully open with a damage ability or heal.
- Exploit Vulnerabilities: Use different arrows to exploit enemy weaknesses (example given: Fire Arrows vs fire-vulnerable enemies; Acid Arrows vs foes with high armor).
- Build priorities:
  - Unlock Minsc and respec to a proper build
  - Equip one hand and shield for better AC
  - Playing at range with Longbow is preferred
  - Find the Legendary Bow
  - Keep to Medium Armour unless you have Helldusk via House of Hope
  - Stack 3 consumables during combat for insane damage (Hill Giant Strength, Potion of Speed, and Oil of Accuracy)
  - Follow the rest of the leveling suggestions outlined below

## Alternative Build Route
- Starting at Level 5, multiclass into Rogue; later invest a few levels into Fighter.
- This path increases overall defense and survivability, and grants access to Action Surge.
- At Level 12, choosing the Champion subclass provides the Improved Critical Hit passive, which synergizes with other effects to reduce the roll needed for a critical hit.

### Alternative Level Progression
- Level 1: Ranger — Wasteland Wanderer: Cold, Bounty Hunter
- Level 2: Ranger — Fighting Style: Archery, Spells: Hunter’s Mark, Longstrider
- Level 3: Ranger — Subclass: Gloom Stalker, Spell: Ensnaring Strike
- Level 4: Ranger — Feat: Sharpshooter
- Level 5: Ranger — Lesser Restoration
- Level 6: Rogue — Skill Proficiency: Acrobatics, Skill Expertise: Sleight of Hand, Stealth
- Level 7: Rogue — Cunning Actions
- Level 8: Rogue — Subclass: Assassin
- Level 9: Rogue — Feat: Ability Improvement Dexterity
- Level 10: Fighter — Fighting Style: Defense
- Level 11: Fighter — Action Surge
- Level 12: Fighter — Subclass: Champion

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 adds new subclasses for every core class; for Ranger, the new option is the Swarmkeeper.
- Swarmkeeper signature ability: Prey’s Scent, which significantly enhances Hunter’s Mark in unique and potent ways.
- A combo mentioned: pairing Moth Attacks with the Resonance Stone found in Act 2, resulting in a major boost to psychic damage output.
- Despite Swarmkeeper utility, the guide considers Gloom Stalker to be the superior subclass for this Minsc build.
