## Build snapshot

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Strike first from stealth with massive burst damage, use high initiative and mobility to control engagement timing, then reposition or vanish to reset fights on your terms.**

### About companion
- Minsc is a **Ranger (Gloom Stalker)** companion built around **stealth ambushes, high initiative, and devastating ranged burst damage** when opening combat.
- He brings **exceptional first-turn damage** through Dread Ambusher (extra attack + bonus damage), combined with stealth tools to consistently attack from invisibility.
- He performs best when you **deploy him to strike first, eliminate priority targets before they act, and use mobility to maintain safe firing positions**.

### Party role
- **First-strike assassin:** Uses high initiative and stealth to delete priority targets on turn one before enemies can respond.
- **Ranged damage dealer:** Delivers consistent bow damage with Hunter's Mark and Extra Attack.
- **Mobile skirmisher:** Uses speed, Misty Step, and stealth to control engagement angles and avoid pressure.

### Pros
- Extremely high first-turn damage (Dread Ambusher + Sharpshooter)
- High initiative (+3 bonus) ensures he acts first
- Stealth and invisibility tools for ambush tactics
- Strong mobility for repositioning and disengagement

### Cons
- Weak area damage options (single-target focused)
- Requires concentration management (Hunter's Mark competes with other spells)
- Low durability if caught in melee or focused
- Joins party late (Act 3 only)

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Archery fighting style** (+2 ranged attack rolls) and **Hunter's Mark** (bonus damage per hit)
- Level 3: **Dread Ambusher** (+3 initiative, extra attack on turn one, +1d8 damage) and **Umbral Shroud** (invisibility in shadows)
- Level 4: **Sharpshooter** (+10 damage per hit, toggleable)
- Level 5: **Extra Attack** (two attacks per action)
- Level 9: **Lightning Arrow** (4d8+2d8 damage as bonus action)
- Level 11: **Stalker's Flurry** (free extra attack on miss)

- **Background:** Outlander
- **Proficiencies:** Perception, Nature, Insight
- **Location (recruitment):** Act 3. Must have recruited Jaheira first. Follow the Counting House quest line, then travel to the Abandoned Cistern in the Sewers. Complete the valve puzzle, fight Minsc (use non-lethal damage), and convince The Emperor to extend artifact protection to him.

### About companion creation fields

## Level-by-level progression (Ranger 1 → 12)
> Treat each level's **Play style** as your default combat loop for deploying Minsc effectively.

### Level 1 – Ranger 1
**Gain**
- **Favoured Enemy: Bounty Hunter** (creatures hit with Ensnaring Strike have disadvantage on saving throw)
- **Natural Explorer: Beast Tamer** (can cast Find Familiar conjuration spell)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Deploy Minsc as a **ranged attacker** focusing on safe angles and high ground.
- Use **Find Familiar** to scout ahead, distract enemies, or explore tight spaces.
- Bounty Hunter synergy won't activate until Ensnaring Strike unlocks, but sets foundation for crowd control options.
- Focus on basic ranged attacks and positioning until spell slots unlock at level 2.

### Level 2 – Ranger 2
**Gain**
- **Fighting Style: Archery** (+2 bonus to ranged attack rolls)
- **Spell Slots:** 2 level 1 slots
- **Spells:** Hunter's Mark, Cure Wounds

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Core damage loop begins: **bonus-action Hunter's Mark → attack twice with +2 to hit from Archery**.
- **Hunter's Mark** adds 1d6 damage per hit and can be reapplied to new targets without spell slot cost.
- Archery fighting style provides consistent accuracy boost for all ranged attacks.
- **Cure Wounds** serves as emergency self-heal or ally support (melee range, costs action).
- Prioritize maintaining Hunter's Mark on highest-threat targets throughout fights.

### Level 3 – Ranger 3 (Gloom Stalker)
**Subclass**
- **Gloom Stalker**

**Gain**
- **Dread Ambusher:** +3 bonus to Initiative. On first combat turn, movement speed increases by 3m and you can make an additional attack that deals +1d8 damage.
- **Umbral Shroud:** Use action to become Invisible if obscured (10 turns duration)
- **Superior Darkvision:** See up to 24m in darkness
- **Dread Ambusher: Hide:** Bonus action to hide from enemies
- **Spell:** Disguise Self, Ensnaring Strike

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Major power spike: **Dread Ambusher makes Minsc strike first** (+3 initiative) with devastating opening damage (extra attack + 1d8).
- Pre-combat strategy: Use **Umbral Shroud** to become invisible before engagement, ensuring surprise on first attack.
- First turn combo: **Hunter's Mark (bonus action) → three attacks** (normal attack + normal attack + Dread Ambusher extra attack with +1d8 damage).
- **Ensnaring Strike (ranged):** Costs action + bonus action + concentration. Emergency crowd control when pressured by melee threats. Bounty Hunter makes targets have disadvantage on save.
- Goal: Always attack from stealth/invisibility on turn one to trigger Surprised status and guarantee advantage.

### Level 4 – Ranger 4
**Feat**
- **Sharpshooter**

**Play style (Level 4)**
- **Sharpshooter** provides toggleable +10 damage per hit at -5 attack roll penalty.
- Toggle ON when: You have advantage (from stealth), target is low AC, or accuracy is already high (Archery fighting style helps compensate).
- Toggle OFF when: Accuracy is critical, fighting high AC targets, or fishing for hits matters more than raw damage.
- Opening turn becomes devastating: **Hunter's Mark + three attacks with Sharpshooter** = potential 30+ bonus damage before weapon dice.
- Ignore high ground penalties with Sharpshooter—maintain damage even from awkward angles.

### Level 5 – Ranger 5
**Gain**
- **Extra Attack:** Make two attacks when taking Attack action
- **Spell Slots:** 4 level 1 slots, 2 level 2 slots
- **Spells:** Spiked Growth, Misty Step

**Play style (Level 5)**
- **Extra Attack** unlocks: Normal turns now provide **two attacks per action** (not counting first-turn Dread Ambusher bonus).
- **Spiked Growth:** 18m range, 6m radius concentration spell. Creates difficult terrain dealing 2d4 piercing per 1.5m moved. Use to control choke points and protect flanks.
- **Misty Step:** Bonus-action teleport for emergency escapes or aggressive repositioning. Does not break stealth when used before attacking.
- Turn one remains king: **Hunter's Mark + Dread Ambusher extra attack + two normal attacks** = four attacks total.
- Use elemental arrows (Ice, Thunder) to add status effects and control battlefield.

### Level 6 – Ranger 6
**Gain**
- **Favoured Enemy: Ranger Knight** (History proficiency and heavy armor proficiency)
- **Natural Explorer: Wasteland Wanderer: Cold** (cold resistance)

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Heavy armor proficiency unlocks but won't be optimal until Helldusk Armour in late Act 3.
- **Cold resistance** reduces incoming cold damage by half—helpful against ice-based enemies and environmental hazards.
- Combat loop unchanged: **stealth opener → Hunter's Mark → maximum attacks with Sharpshooter**.
- Continue prioritizing high ground, safe angles, and first-strike advantage.

### Level 7 – Ranger 7
**Gain**
- **Iron Mind:** Gain proficiency in Wisdom and Intelligence saving throws
- **Spell Slots:** 4 level 1 slots, 3 level 2 slots
- **Spell:** Lesser Restoration

**Play style (Level 7)**
- **Iron Mind** dramatically improves survivability against mind-affecting spells and abilities.
- **Lesser Restoration:** Cures disease, poison, paralysis, or blindness. Critical utility for removing debilitating conditions.
- **Land's Stride:** Move through difficult terrain without speed penalty (passive feature).
- Combat identity remains focused: **first strike from stealth, maintain Hunter's Mark, use mobility to avoid pressure**.
- Lesser Restoration provides flexibility to cleanse conditions without relying on consumables.

### Level 8 – Ranger 8
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Dexterity** (increases Dexterity to 18)

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Higher Dexterity improves: attack rolls, damage rolls, AC, initiative, and Dexterity saves.
- More reliable Sharpshooter usage: +1 attack bonus helps compensate for -5 penalty.
- Continue leveraging stealth, Hunter's Mark, and Extra Attack for consistent damage output.
- Prioritize consumable stacking: Elixir of Hill Giant Strength, Potion of Speed, and Oil of Accuracy create massive damage windows.

### Level 9 – Ranger 9
**Gain**
- **Spell Slots:** 4 level 1 slots, 3 level 2 slots, 2 level 3 slots
- **Spells:** Fear (subclass spell), Lightning Arrow, Stoneskin

**Play style (Level 9)**
- **Fear (subclass spell):** Projects frightening image, targets drop weapons and become Fearful (easier to hit, cannot move). Costs action + concentration. Situational—use for locking down groups or creating escape windows.
- **Lightning Arrow:** Bonus-action spell dealing 4d8+2d8 lightning damage in melee range. Combo with Thunder Arrow to knock back enemies rushing you.
- **Stoneskin:** Grants resistance to non-magical Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing damage until long rest. Requires concentration. Pre-cast after long rest before difficult encounters for defensive layer.
- Replace Lesser Restoration with Stoneskin for difficult fights where you know heavy physical damage is incoming.
- Multiple concentration options now available—choose based on situation: Hunter's Mark (damage), Stoneskin (defense), or Spiked Growth (control).

### Level 10 – Ranger 10
**Gain**
- **Hide in Plain Sight:** Camouflage yourself to become Invisible with +10 Stealth until long rest (ends if you move, attack, cast, or take damage)
- **Favoured Enemy: Mage Breaker** (Arcana proficiency, can cast True Strike)
- **Natural Explorer: Urban Tracker** (Sleight of Hand proficiency)

**Play style (Level 10)**
- **Hide in Plain Sight:** Pre-combat invisibility tool for guaranteed first-strike advantage. Use before major encounters.
- **Sleight of Hand proficiency:** Adds utility for stealing and lockpicking—reduces need for dedicated Rogue in party.
- True Strike cantrip (from Mage Breaker) rarely used—standard attacks more efficient.
- Combat loop solidified: **pre-buff with Hide in Plain Sight → open from invisibility → unload full damage with Dread Ambusher**.

### Level 11 – Ranger 11
**Gain**
- **Stalker's Flurry:** When you miss a weapon attack, make another weapon attack for free
- **Spell Slots:** 4 level 1 slots, 3 level 2 slots, 3 level 3 slots
- **Spell:** Conjure Barrage

**Play style (Level 11)**
- **Stalker's Flurry** is exceptional passive: converts misses into additional attacks, increasing damage consistency.
- Particularly strong with Sharpshooter active (higher miss chance = more free attacks triggered).
- **Conjure Barrage:** 2d8 slashing damage in 9m cone (half damage on save). No concentration required. Minsc's only area damage option.
- Combo: **Lightning Arrow (bonus action) + Conjure Barrage (action)** for burst area damage when enemies cluster.
- Stalker's Flurry makes aggressive Sharpshooter usage more forgiving—missed shots generate comeback attacks.

### Level 12 – Ranger 12
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Dexterity** (increases Dexterity to 20)

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Maximum Dexterity achieved: **peak accuracy, damage, AC, and initiative**.
- Final combat identity: **Guaranteed first strike (high initiative + stealth), devastating opening burst (Dread Ambusher + Sharpshooter + Hunter's Mark), consistent follow-up damage (Extra Attack + Stalker's Flurry)**.
- Stack consumables for hardest encounters: Hill Giant Strength + Speed + Oil of Accuracy = unmatched damage output.
- Maintain mobility and positioning discipline—Minsc deletes targets but cannot tank sustained pressure.
