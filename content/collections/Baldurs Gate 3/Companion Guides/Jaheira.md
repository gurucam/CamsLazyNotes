- Double Healing: Use spells like Goodberries and Healing Word to provide healing in one turn.
- Use Consumables: In critical situations, you can use a Potion of Speed or an ally to shoot a Fire Arrow to turn the tide of battle.
- Prone: Try to use ice spells to proc the prone status effect so late-game wild-shape forms can do better damage.
- Extra Attack: Make sure to attack twice in Wild Shape form after level 5 to get the most damage out of the build.
- Opening Turn: Use your hard-hitting damage spells as an opener and use a bonus action to go into Wild Shape.

## Alternative Build Route
For our alternative Jaheira build, we’re introducing a multiclass option that dips into Wizard at Level 8. This setup blends the Circle of Spores subclass with the Evocation Wizard, creating a high-impact spellcaster focused on damage. With Evocation’s Sculpt Spells feature, you can unleash powerful area-of-effect magic without harming allies, making this build ideal for players who want a more aggressive, spell-focused take on the Druid. It’s a different playstyle where you trade healing and shapeshifting for raw magical firepower.

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- The most significant change to the Druid class in Patch 8 of Baldur’s Gate 3 is the addition of the Circle of Stars subclass.
- Circle of the Moon subclass still remains the strongest for Druids in BG3.
- While Jaheira joins your party as a Circle of the Land Druid, it’s highly recommended that you reroll her class.

### Patch 7
- Jaheira received mostly minor changes to dialogue and some bug fixes in Patch 7 of Baldur’s Gate 3.
- Larian Studios’ main focus in this patch is mods and some new cinematic evil endings.
