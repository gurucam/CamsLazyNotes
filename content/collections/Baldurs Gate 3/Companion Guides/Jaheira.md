## Build snapshot

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Transform into powerful beasts via Wild Shape, deal heavy melee damage and control crowds, then return to humanoid form to cast support spells or area damage when needed.**

### About companion
- Jaheira is a **Druid (Circle of the Moon)** companion built around **Wild Shape transformations, nature magic, and versatile combat roles**.
- She brings **high survivability through multiple health pools** (Wild Shape acts as temporary HP), strong melee damage in beast form, and access to healing and crowd control spells.
- She performs best when you **deploy her to transform early, pressure frontlines or crowds, and exit Wild Shape strategically to cast key spells**.

### Party role
- **Frontline damage & tank:** Wild Shape forms provide massive HP pools and melee attacks to hold lines or rush priority targets.
- **Crowd control & support:** Access to area damage, status effects, and healing spells for battlefield control.
- **Versatile combatant:** Can fill melee, spellcaster, or support roles depending on combat needs.

### Pros
- High durability through Wild Shape (multiple effective health bars)
- Strong melee damage and crowd control options
- Nature magic provides healing, summons, and area damage
- Versatile playstyle adapts to party needs

### Cons
- Cannot cast spells while in Wild Shape form
- Default build (Circle of the Land) is suboptimal for combat
- Joins party late (end of Act 2)
- Requires understanding of when to transform vs when to cast

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Combat Wild Shape** (bonus action transformation) and **Lunar Mend** (self-heal in Wild Shape)
- Level 4: **Deep Rothé form** (charge and crowd control)
- Level 5: **Wild Strike** (extra attack in Wild Shape) and **level 3 spells** (Call Lightning, Sleet Storm)
- Level 6: **Panther and Owlbear forms** (high damage and area control)
- Level 8: **Sabre-Toothed Tiger form** (massive damage to prone targets)
- Level 9: **Conjure Elemental** (powerful summon without concentration)
- Level 10: **Water Myrmidon form** (damage + healing in Wild Shape) and **Improved Wild Strike** (two extra attacks)

- **Subclass:** Circle of the Moon (recommended respec from default Circle of the Land)
- **Background:** Soldier

### Starting setup
- **Weapon plan:** Prefer **quarterstaff with shield** (field use), transitioning to legendary quarterstaffs in late game for spell slot efficiency.

## Level-by-level progression (Druid 1 → 12)
> Treat each level's **Play style** as your default combat loop for deploying Jaheira effectively.

### Level 1 – Druid 1
**Gain**
- **Cantrips:** Shillelagh, Thorn Whip
- **Spells:** Healing Word, Ice Knife, Thunderwave, Cure Wounds

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Deploy Jaheira as a **spellcaster with utility cantrips** until Wild Shape unlocks at level 2.
- Use **Shillelagh** as a bonus action to enhance staff damage (uses Wisdom for attack rolls, deals 1d8+2).
- **Ice Knife** provides ranged damage and can cause prone status effect.
- **Thorn Whip** pulls targets 3m closer for positioning control.
- Save **Healing Word** for emergency bonus-action heals at range.
- Use **Thunderwave** offensively to knock enemies off ledges or create space.

### Level 2 – Druid 2 (Circle of the Moon)
**Subclass**
- **Circle of the Moon**

**Gain**
- **Combat Wild Shape:** Wild Shape now uses a Bonus Action instead of an Action (two charges per short rest)
- **Lunar Mend:** Expend spell slots to regain hit points while in Wild Shape (1d8 per spell slot level)
- **Wild Shape Forms Available:** Badger, Bear, Cat, Spider, Wolf
- **Spell:** Entangle

**Play style (Level 2)**
- The core combat loop begins: **cast a powerful spell with your action, then bonus-action Wild Shape**.
- **Opening turn:** Use Ice Knife or Thunderwave first, then transform into Wild Shape (typically Badger for damage + crowd control, or Wolf for higher damage).
- **Wild Shape as extra health bar:** If you reach 0 HP in Wild Shape, you revert to humanoid form instead of going down.
- **Badger form:** 13 HP, has Claw (knockback), Bite, and Burrow attacks. Great for crowd control with knockback.
- **Wolf form:** 18 HP, has Inciting Howl (increases allies' movement), Bite, and Exposing Bite (guarantees next attack is critical). Higher damage option.
- **Bear form:** 30 HP, has Goading Roar (taunt), Claws. Best tank option.
- Exit Wild Shape manually when you need to cast spells or heal allies.
- Use **Lunar Mend** to self-heal in Wild Shape by expending spell slots.

### Level 3 – Druid 3
**Gain**
- **Level 2 spell slots**
- **Spell:** Flaming Sphere

**Play style (Level 3)**
- **Flaming Sphere** becomes your premier opening spell: summons a sphere at range that damages nearby enemies, has high HP, and soaks damage for your party.
- Cast **Flaming Sphere** with your action, then bonus-action Wild Shape. This maintains concentration and the sphere continues to pressure enemies.
- The sphere often absorbs all incoming damage, protecting your party.
- Use this combination when expecting heavy damage from multiple sources.

### Level 4 – Druid 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Wisdom** (increases Wisdom to 18)

**Gain**
- **Cantrip:** Guidance
- **Spell:** Heat Metal
- **Wild Shape Form Available:** Deep Rothé

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Higher Wisdom improves spell save DC and healing output.
- **Heat Metal:** Forces targets wearing metal armor/weapons to drop equipment or take damage. Requires concentration. Excellent against Fighters and Barbarians.
- **Deep Rothé form:** 23 HP, has Gore (damage) and Charge (area knockback that knocks enemies prone). Excellent for mobility, melee damage, and crowd control.
- **Guidance:** Use as bonus action outside combat to give allies +1d4 to ability checks (dialogue, lockpicking, etc.).
- Opening flexibility: Use either Flaming Sphere or Heat Metal depending on enemy composition, then Wild Shape into Deep Rothé for charge attacks.

### Level 5 – Druid 5
**Gain**
- **Wild Strike:** Make an additional attack after making an unarmed strike while in Wild Shape
- **Level 3 spell slots**
- **Spells:** Call Lightning, Sleet Storm

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Major power spike: **level 3 spells** and **Wild Strike** (extra attack in Wild Shape).
- **Call Lightning:** Massive area damage spell that can be recast each turn without expending spell slots. Use your action to call lightning again on subsequent turns.
- **Sleet Storm:** 9m radius area damage that creates ice surface, disrupts caster concentration, and causes prone. Cast at choke points or to shut down ranged casters.
- **Wild Strike:** Attack twice in Wild Shape form, significantly increasing melee damage output.
- Ideal turn sequence: Cast Call Lightning or Sleet Storm as opener, then Wild Shape on turn two and use melee attacks with Wild Strike.

### Level 6 – Druid 6
**Gain**
- **Primal Strike:** While in beast form, attacks count as magical to overcome resistance
- **Wild Shape Forms Available:** Panther, Owlbear
- **Spell:** Gust of Wind

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Two powerful new Wild Shape forms unlock:
- **Panther form:** 45 HP, has Jugular Strike (extra damage to prone enemies), Prowl (invisibility), and Pounce. High single-target damage, especially against prone targets.
- **Owlbear form:** 65 HP, has Enrage (area frighten effect) and Rupture (area damage). Massive HP pool and excellent area control. Use when rushing large groups.
- **Gust of Wind:** 5m knockback spell, better version of Thunderwave for area control.
- Form selection: Use Panther when focusing single priority targets (especially if allies can cause prone), Owlbear when facing large groups needing area damage and control.
- All Wild Shape attacks now count as magical, overcoming resistance to non-magical damage.

### Level 7 – Druid 7
**Gain**
- **Level 4 spell slots**
- **Spells:** Ice Storm, Conjure Woodland Being

**Play style (Level 7)**
- **Ice Storm:** 2d8 bludgeoning + 4d6 cold damage in massive 6m radius. Can trigger status effects. Major area damage option.
- **Conjure Woodland Being:** Summons a fey creature that does NOT require concentration. Can be used alongside Flaming Sphere for two summons aiding you.
- Woodland creatures have numerous spells and skills for damage and crowd control.
- Strategy: Use Conjure Woodland Being at the start of tough fights (it can fulfill control/damage role), then Wild Shape into damage form.
- For difficult encounters, prioritize Conjure Woodland Being over Ice Storm to maintain persistent pressure.

### Level 8 – Druid 8
**Feat**
- **War Caster** (Advantage on Concentration saves; reaction to cast Shocking Grasp at targets leaving melee range)

**Gain**
- **Wild Shape Form Available:** Sabre-Toothed Tiger
- **Spell:** Confusion

**Play style (Level 8)**
- **War Caster:** Dramatically improves concentration spell reliability (critical since you're often concentrating on Flaming Sphere, Call Lightning, or summons).
- **Sabre-Toothed Tiger form:** 62 HP, has Shred Armour (weakens enemies) and Jugular Strike (massive damage to prone targets). Best single-target damage form. Focus prone targets for maximum output.
- **Confusion:** Massive crowd control spell. Causes enemies to attack randomly, wander aimlessly, or skip turns. One of the best CC spells due to large area.
- Combine cold damage spells (to cause prone) with Sabre-Toothed Tiger form for devastating single-target damage.

### Level 9 – Druid 9
**Gain**
- **Level 5 spell slots**
- **Spells:** Conjure Elemental, Mass Cure Wounds

**Play style (Level 9)**
- **Conjure Elemental:** Summons one of four elemental creatures (Air, Earth, Fire, Water) that does NOT require concentration. Earth Elemental can stun opponents. Summon persists even when you Wild Shape.
- Can pre-cast Conjure Elemental before combat after long rest and maintain it throughout encounters.
- **Mass Cure Wounds:** Heals up to 6 creatures for 3d8 + Wisdom modifier. Generous radius. Excellent group heal.
- Combine Mass Cure Wounds with bonus-action Healing Word for massive healing output in one turn.
- Opening strategy: Pre-cast Conjure Elemental, use it for persistent pressure, then Wild Shape for melee combat.

### Level 10 – Druid 10
**Gain**
- **Improved Wild Strike:** Make 2 additional attacks after making an unarmed strike while in Wild Shape
- **Wild Shape Forms Available:** Dilophosaurus, Air Myrmidon, Earth Myrmidon, Fire Myrmidon, Water Myrmidon
- **Cantrip:** Poison Spray
- **Spell:** Insect Plague

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Major power spike: **Improved Wild Strike** gives you two extra attacks in Wild Shape (total of 3 attacks).
- **Myrmidon forms** (subclass feature for Circle of the Moon): Cost 2 Wild Shape charges instead of 1, but considerably more powerful.
- **Water Myrmidon:** Preferred form. Has ice damage attacks AND a healing spell, allowing you to stay in Wild Shape while off-healing. Other Wild Shapes cannot heal.
- **Insect Plague:** Locusts attack everyone in range, create difficult terrain, impose disadvantage on Perception.
- **Dilophosaurus form:** Has Corrosive Spit that dissolves target's AC. Less frequently used than Myrmidons.
- Combat loop: Cast Insect Plague, transform into Water Myrmidon, maintain summon (Conjure Elemental) for three sources of pressure.

### Level 11 – Druid 11
**Gain**
- **Level 6 spell slots**
- **Spells:** Heroes' Feast, Heal

**Play style (Level 11)**
- **Heroes' Feast:** Produces feast for 12 guests that cures diseases, immunizes to poison, increases HP by 2d10 for 24 hours. Lasts until long rest. Cast immediately after long rest.
- **Heal:** Best single-target heal in game (70 HP). Also removes Blindness and diseases.
- Only one level 6 spell slot per long rest. Use legendary quarterstaffs (Markoheshkir or Staff of Spellpower) to negate spell cost, allowing you to cast both Heroes' Feast (after long rest) and Heal (in combat).
- Pre-cast Heroes' Feast after long rest to buff entire party, save Heal for critical moments.

### Level 12 – Druid 12
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Wisdom** (increases Wisdom to 20)

**Gain**
- **Spell:** Stoneskin

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Maximum Wisdom (20) improves spell save DC, damage, and healing.
- **Stoneskin:** Grants resistance to all non-magical Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. Lasts until long rest. Requires concentration.
- Cast Stoneskin immediately after long rest (alongside Heroes' Feast and Conjure Elemental) to pre-buff before combat.
- More spells that last until long rest = more pre-casting = more actions available in actual combat.
- Final combat identity: Pre-buff with long-duration spells, open with area damage or summons, Wild Shape into Water Myrmidon or Sabre-Toothed Tiger, use Improved Wild Strike for massive damage, exit to cast emergency heals or controls.
