## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Great Weapon Fighting
  - Second Wind
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Attack with a melee weapon.
    - Turn 2+: Continue attacking with a melee weapon.
  - Notes:
    - Aim to pick up a Greatsword right away.
    - Your goal is to get a two-handed weapon.
    - Ideally, during the prologue, you get the Everburn Blade and give it to Lae’zel.
    - Use the medium armor you have until you find better heavy and get a crossbow.
    - If you can, unlock Withers as early as level 2 just after the prologue, and respec Lae’zel for the correct ability score.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Action Surge
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Action Surge to gain one additional Action (often an additional attack).
    - Turn 2+: Short Rest to replenish Action Surge.
  - Notes:
    - Gameplay you now have a way to get two attacks in one turn along with a self-heal.
    - Play aggressively and charge in.
    - Don’t forget to equip a bow because you want some type of range weapon when melee isn’t an option because of distance.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Battle Master
  - Disarming Attack
  - Trip Attack
  - Riposte
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use control manoeuvres (Disarming Attack / Trip Attack) as needed.
    - Turn 2+: Continue crowd control and weapon damage; use Action Surge when you need another attack.
  - Notes:
    - Superiority Dice are d8s; think of this as an additional resource that can be replenished during a Long Rest.
    - You will also get to select three maneuvers which are attacks that consume superiority dice.
    - Disarming Attack: Spend a superiority die to make an attack that deals an additional 1d8 damage and possibly forces the target to drop the weapons they are holding.
      - You can disarm and even pick up the weapon immediately following preventing the enemy from using it.
      - This doesn’t work on casters.
    - Trip Attack: Spend a superiority die to make an attack that deals an additional 1d8 damage and possibly knocks the target Prone. The target must be Large or smaller.
    - Riposte: When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, expend a superiority die to retaliate with a powerful strike that deals an additional 1d8 damage.
    - You can also use Pommel Strike on a Greatsword to proc Daze as well.
    - Short rest after every battle if possible to replenish your resources.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Feat: Great Weapon Master
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Initiate combat using your action first, saving your bonus action for a Great Weapons Master attack.
    - Turn 2+: Focus on kills to get bonus action extra attack.
  - Notes:
    - Great Weapon Master: When a melee attack scores a critical hit or kills a creature, you can make another melee attack as a bonus action.
    - When attacking with Heavy Weapons you are proficient with, attack rolls take a -5 penalty, but their damage increases by 10.
    - You can turn this off in the Passive section on your toolbar.
    - Just go to passives and toggle GWM off, if you are in the 30% and want more consistent damage until a higher level.
    - You are just one level away from an awe-inspiring Extra Attack.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Extra Attack
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Attack twice with Extra Attack; if you kill an enemy or critical strike, attack again with Great Weapon Master.
    - Turn 2+: Use Action Surge to attack another two times.
  - Notes:
    - In one turn, you can attack twice with Extra Attack, kill an enemy or critical strike, and attack again with Great Weapon Master.
    - You use Action Surge and attack another two times for a total of 5 in one turn.
    - You can make it 7 by either using a potion of speed or having someone cast Haste on you.
    - You need to use superiority dice and those attacks sparingly when the situation calls for it. Otherwise, just keep it simple and blast people with multiple attacks!
    - Multiclass Options for Lae’zel: At level 5, you can decide to multiclass the Fighter with Lae’zel. Having completed Tactician, we highly recommend not doing so.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement Strength (+2 Strength, total 18)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Great Weapon Master (toggle on when percentages improve).
    - Turn 2+: Use the spell Bless or have someone cast it on you for much higher percentages and big damage!
  - Notes:
    - This will help us hit harder, and more likely to land attacks which is especially handy with Great Weapons Master.
    - If you have this toggled off due to lower percentages of chances to strike, turn it back on.

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Precision Attack
  - Pushing Attack
  - Superiority Dice: +1 (additional Superiority Dice)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Activate Precision Attack after long resting for a big opener next fight.
    - Turn 2+: Use Pushing Attack for knockbacks and ledge kills when available.
  - Notes:
    - Precision Attack: Your next weapon attack gets an Attack Roll bonus equal to your Superiority Die.
      - The nice thing about this attack is it doesn’t require an action, just a superiority die resource.
      - As soon as you get done long resting, you can activate it immediately for a big opener next fight.
    - Pushing Attack: Spend a superiority die to deal damage type depending on the weapon used and possibly push the target back 4.5m.
      - You can get many kills from knocking enemies off ledges.

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Feat: Alert
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Open up with the Fighter to crowd control, or kill multiple targets.
    - Turn 2+: Use high Initiative positioning to reduce incoming damage.
  - Notes:
    - Alert: You gain a +5 bonus to Initiative and can’t be Surprised.
    - The weakness of the Fighter is going way later in the round.
    - In some fights, particularly dialogue-based consequences later in Acts 2 and 3, you will be surprised after a conversation with combat starting immediately.
    - Without this benefit, your entire team will miss one turn. With Alert, you can’t be Surprised.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Indomitable
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue standard Fighter attacks and manoeuvres as needed.
    - Turn 2+: Use Indomitable automatically when a Saving Throw is failed (feature effect).
  - Notes:
    - Whenever you fail a Saving Throw, you can roll again, using the new result instead.

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Sweeping Attack
  - Goading Attack
  - Improved Superiority Dice (Superiority Dice become 1d10)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Sweeping Attack when you need area-based AOE damage.
    - Turn 2+: Use Goading Attack when a Wizard or spellcaster is getting harassed by a damage dealer.
  - Notes:
    - Sweeping Attack: Swing your weapon in a rapid, sweeping arc to attack multiple enemies at once. Roll your superiority die for damage.
    - Goading Attack: Deal an additional 1d8 and attempt to goad the target into attacking you. Target receives Disadvantage on attacking any other creature.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Improved Extra Attack
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use your action-heavy kit (multiple attacks + Action Surge + Great Weapon Master bonus action).
    - Turn 2+: Add Haste / Potion of Speed when available for additional actions.
  - Notes:
    - Improved Extra Attack: You can make two additional attacks after attacking with your main-hand weapon.
    - This makes the Fighter the most action-heavy class and build in BG3.
    - With Great Weapon Master, you can use your bonus action for another attack.
    - Not to mention the additional action you’ll get if someone casts Haste on you, or you use a Potion of Speed.

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement Strength (+2 Strength, total 20)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue action-heavy Fighter turns (attacks + Action Surge + Great Weapon Master).
    - Turn 2+: Use Potion of Speed / Haste when needed.
  - Notes:
    - Improving our Strength to 20 is the play with this feat.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Lae’zel Gameplay & Priorities (early phase):
  - Complete Prologue
  - Recruit Other Companions
  - Reached Hollowed City/Druid Grove
  - Sell, Stock up, complete quest
  - Unlock Withers, respec to proper ability score
  - Progress to level 5
  - Reach Underdark and Grymforged
- During the early phase of BG3, Lae’zel as a two-handed Fighter will be very strong.
- Your primary goal is to find a back-bar ranged weapon at the start of the game.
- The Heavy Crossbow or Longbow is great until you reach level 5 with the Misty Step spell.
- Look to acquire Elixir of Hill Giant Strength and Oil of Accuracy. You can combine these two for huge damage increases.
- 10 combat gameplay tips and tricks:
  1. Initial Turn: Make sure your initial move either puts you in melee range so you can strike or attack with a range weapon.
  2. Bonus Action: Make use of your bonus action with skills like Pommel or even shove to knock back enemies.
  3. Potion of Speed: Use these potions to gain more movement and additional action.
  4. Long Rest: Make sure to rest when your Superiority Dies counters are low so you start with many available.
  5. Equip Range: Find and equip a bow early because it will increase your kill potential and take advantage of the fighter’s weapon versatility.
  6. Make use of Action Surge: Save Action Surge for critical moments in combat or to gain an advantage over tough opponents.
  7. Action and Bonus Actions: Use your bonus action for potions, Great Weapon Master, or apply Oils to weapons.
  8. Maximize your Attacks: Use Action Surge in conjunction with Bloodlust and Potion of Speed for 4 Actions in 1 turn.
  9. Weapon Selection: Consider Greatswords, Longbows, and Heavy Crossbows as the best weapons for Lae’zel.
  10. Utilize Maneuvers: Use Maneuvers frequently and always short rest to replenish the resources post-combat.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative Lae’zel Fighter Build – Spellcaster Playstyle:
  - Consider transitioning her into an Eldritch Knight build with a splash of Warlock.
  - By taking 11 levels in Fighter (Eldritch Knight) and dipping 1 level into Hexblade Warlock at Level 12, you unlock a wealth of spellcasting versatility without compromising her martial dominance.
  - While Warlock relies on Charisma, and Lae’zel is not built for it naturally, the sheer utility this dip offers makes it a worthwhile trade.
  - You’ll still have enough feat flexibility to reach 20 Strength and pick up Great Weapon Master, preserving your raw melee power.
  - Furthermore, if you start with 17 Strength during character creation and plan to secure Auntie Ethel’s +1 bonus in Act 1, hitting 20 Strength is easy and efficient.
- Alternative Build Leveling (11 Fighter Eldritch Knight / 1 Warlock Hexblade):
  - Level 1: Fighter — Great Weapon Fighting
  - Level 2: Fighter — –
  - Level 3: Fighter — Subclass: Eldritch Knight, Booming Blade, Friends, Shield, Thunderwave, Longstrider
  - Level 4: Fighter — Feat: +2 STR, Chromatic Orb
  - Level 5: Fighter — –
  - Level 6: Fighter — Feat: Great Weapon Master
  - Level 7: Fighter — Darkness, Gust of Wind
  - Level 8: Fighter — Feat: Savage Attacker, Misty Step
  - Level 9: Fighter — –
  - Level 10: Fighter — Firebolt, Protection from Good and Evil
  - Level 11: Fighter — Scorching Ray
  - Level 12: Warlock — Hexblade Subclass, Eldritch Blast, Toll of the Dead, Hexed, Hellish Rebuke

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 brings a major shake-up to Baldur’s Gate 3, introducing 12 new subclasses that dramatically expand the possibilities for character customization.
- One of the biggest winners from this update is the Eldritch Knight Fighter, who now benefits immensely from access to the Booming Blade cantrip.
- Another standout change is the emergence of a new powerhouse multiclass option: Fighter/Warlock.
- Combining Eldritch Knight with a one-level dip into Hexblade Warlock offers a flexible and potent alternative to the classic Fighter/Paladin synergy.
- While we still recommend the pure Battle Master Fighter for players who enjoy a more direct, martial-focused experience, the new subclass and multiclass options are worth serious consideration.
- For those wanting to enhance their magical toolkit without straying too far from the Fighter’s strengths, the 11/1 Fighter-Hexblade split hits a sweet spot.
- You only sacrifice one feat, but still have room to reach 20 Strength and take Great Weapon Master.

### Patch 7
- The release of Patch 7 for Baldur’s Gate 3 only impacted Lae’zel with minor bug fixes and dialogue additions.
- Lae’zel’s Fighter build, combat, and gameplay elements remained untouched.
- Larian Studios’ main focus in this patch is mods and with new cinematics for evil endings.
- The game now features a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager, allowing players to create and install mods directly within the game.
- This best Lae’zel Build Guide remains unchanged, mainly in Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 7.
