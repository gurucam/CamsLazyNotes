## Build snapshot

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Deploy Gale as a safe, backline AoE controller who pre-buffs for survival, deletes clustered enemies with Evocation blasts, and uses reactions/teleports to stay uncatchable.**

### About companion
- Gale is a **Human Wizard (Evocation)** companion focused on **large-area spell damage** while avoiding ally damage through Evocation’s safety features.
- He plays best as your **battlefield “problem solver”**: controlling space early (Grease/Sleep), then scaling into **fight-ending AoE** (Fireball/Ice Storm/Cloudkill) with strong single-target pressure when needed.
- He is most effective when you **deploy him at range**, pre-buffed (Mage Armour), with an escape plan (Misty Step) and at least one reaction-ready answer (Counterspell).

### Party role
- **AoE damage dealer:** deletes groups and punishes clustered enemies.
- **Battlefield control:** creates choke points and tempo swings with surfaces and crowd control.
- **Utility caster:** scribing/versatility means he can cover gaps (movement, defense, summons, niche elements).

### Pros
- Massive area damage scaling into late game
- Evocation tools reduce friendly-fire risk for big AoE casts
- Spell versatility via prepared spells + scribing

### Cons
- Low durability if caught or focused
- Can feel slot-hungry early (rests and resource management matter)
- Positioning and concentration discipline are mandatory

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Evocation** (Sculpt Spells / Evocation Savant)
- Level 5: **Fireball + Haste** access (build starts feeling “online”)
- Level 6: **Potent Cantrip** (more reliable fallback cantrips)
- Level 10: **Empowered Evocation** (damage scaling via INT mod)
- Level 11–12: **Disintegrate / Globe of Invulnerability / Chain Lightning** for endgame control and nukes

## Level-by-level progression (Wizard 1 → 12)
> Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop for deploying Gale effectively.

### Level 1 — Wizard 1
**Gain**
- **Cantrips (as presented in source):** Ray of Frost, Acid Splash, Fire Bolt
- **Arcane Recovery**
- **Prepared spells (as presented in source context):** Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Grease, Sleep, Chromatic Orb

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Start every adventuring day by **casting Mage Armour after a long rest**; this is your baseline survivability plan.
- Use early turns to **control tempo**: Sleep and Grease are your “stop the fight from snowballing” tools; Fire Bolt pairs well with Grease for pressure and environment plays.
- Keep **Thunderwave** as your emergency “get off me” button when melee closes in, and use **Magic Missile** for reliable kill-secures when accuracy matters.

### Level 2 — Wizard 2 (Evocation)
**Subclass**
- **Evocation**

**Gain**
- **Sculpt Spells**
- **Evocation Savant**
- **Spells to take at this level (as presented in source):** Find Familiar, Feather Fall

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Your identity becomes “safe AoE”: Sculpt Spells lets you **use area spells more freely** without collateral damage risk to allies.
- Treat Find Familiar as **field utility** (scouting angles, exploration friction, and small positioning advantages), not as your main damage plan.
- Keep the same fight flow: **pre-buff → control space → spend slots when it matters**, then fall back to cantrips when you need to conserve resources.

### Level 3 — Wizard 3
**Gain**
- **Spells to take (as presented in source):** Misty Step, Scorching Ray

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Misty Step becomes your **panic button and reposition tool**: it’s a bonus action escape that protects your action economy.
- Use Scorching Ray when you need **focused damage** that can split targets or pile rays into one priority enemy.
- If your bar feels crowded, prioritize keeping **one mobility option** available (Misty Step via spell or item) so you can consistently stay alive.

### Level 4 — Wizard 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Intelligence** (as presented in source)

**Gain**
- **Spells to take (as presented in source):** Flaming Sphere, Mirror Image
- **Cantrip to take (as presented in source):** Blade Ward

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Use Flaming Sphere as a **decoy and pressure tool** in melee-heavy fights when you want something else soaking attention while you set up a better turn.
- Mirror Image is your “I’m getting targeted too often” answer—pair it with Mage Armour to raise survivability when encounters get rough.
- Continue to alternate between **resource-heavy turns** (Scorching Ray / Chromatic Orb / Flaming Sphere) and **resource-light turns** (cantrips) based on fight length.

### Level 5 — Wizard 5
**Gain**
- **Spells to take (as presented in source):** Fireball, Haste

**Play style (Level 5)**
- This is your major spike: Fireball is your **fight-shaping AoE nuke**. Use it to delete clusters, collapse backlines, or force enemy repositioning.
- Haste is your **high-impact utility**—best when you can protect concentration and when the target can convert extra actions into real advantage.
- Do not cast Haste if you expect to take heavy hits; losing concentration at the wrong time can punish your turn sequence.

### Level 6 — Wizard 6
**Gain**
- **Subclass feature:** Potent Cantrip
- **Spells to take (as presented in source):** Counterspell, Glyph of Warding

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Counterspell is a **reaction tax** you should plan for: try to keep at least one slot available so you can deny enemy spell spikes.
- Glyph of Warding adds a flexible **trap-like AoE** option with elemental choices; use it when you can predict pathing or set a punishing zone.
- Your “default loop” becomes: **Mage Armour baseline → position safe → AoE when value is high → reaction safety net**.

### Level 7 — Wizard 7
**Gain**
- **Spells to take (as presented in source):** Ice Storm, Banishment

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Ice Storm is your **big-radius dual-type AoE** for deleting groups and creating chaos; it’s your Fireball alternative when you want cold pressure and surface disruption.
- Banishment is your **single-target crowd control**: remove the most dangerous enemy while you clean up everything else, but respect concentration risk.
- If survivability is a problem, treat your prepared list as flexible—swap in defensive tools (like Mirror Image / Misty Step) as needed without changing your overall deployment role.

### Level 8 — Wizard 8
**Feat**
- **Spell Sniper** (as presented in source)

**Gain**
- **Spells to take (as presented in source):** Greater Invisibility, Blight
- **Cantrip to take (as presented in source):** Eldritch Blast

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Greater Invisibility is a powerful **utility and survivability lever**: use it to keep a key ally functioning or to protect Gale when fights get messy.
- Blight gives you a **single-target damage spike** in a different damage type when you need to delete a priority target instead of clearing a pack.
- Eldritch Blast becomes a strong **“no slots needed”** fallback option when resources are drained or you want reliable ranged pressure.

### Level 9 — Wizard 9
**Gain**
- **Spells to take (as presented in source):** Cloudkill, Conjure Elemental

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Cloudkill is a **zone-denial blender**: drop it where enemies must choose between staying and taking damage or moving into worse positions.
- Conjure Elemental adds a major **no-concentration ally** that can apply pressure, soak hits, and extend your action economy through fights.
- Your best turns are now “layered”: **summon + AoE zone + safe positioning**, then maintain control while your party cleans up.

### Level 10 — Wizard 10
**Gain**
- **Subclass feature:** Empowered Evocation
- **Spells to take (as presented in source):** Telekinesis, Cone of Cold
- **Cantrip to take (as presented in source):** True Strike

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Empowered Evocation increases the payoff of your Evocation casts—your INT now **directly scales damage**, so your AoE turns get scarier.
- Telekinesis is your “battlefield physics” tool: throw threats away, reposition enemies, or outright end fights by dropping targets into lethal terrain when available.
- Cone of Cold adds a devastating **cone-shaped AoE**; use it when you can line multiple enemies and secure big value without exposing Gale.

### Level 11 — Wizard 11
**Gain**
- **Spells to take (as presented in source):** Disintegrate, Globe of Invulnerability

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Disintegrate is your premium **single-target nuke**: reserve it for priority kills, boss pressure, or “this must die now” moments.
- Globe of Invulnerability is your emergency **turtle button** when fights become overwhelming; protect your team or stabilize a lethal situation, but respect concentration.
- Because level 6 slots are limited, plan around **one decisive level-6 moment per long rest** unless your gear changes that economy.

### Level 12 — Wizard 12
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Intelligence** (as presented in source)

**Gain**
- **Spells to take (as presented in source):** Chain Lightning, Create Undead

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Chain Lightning becomes your premier **multi-target delete button** when enemies are spaced but still chainable.
- Create Undead adds another pressure ally option for longer fights and sustained value over an adventuring day.
- At cap, your deployment discipline matters most: **pre-buff, stay safe, spend slots on high-value moments, and control the battlefield with zones and reactions**.
