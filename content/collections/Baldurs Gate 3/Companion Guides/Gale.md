## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Cantrips: Ray of Frost, Acid Splash, Fire Bolt
  - Arcane Recovery (recover two spell slots: either two level 1 spell slots or one level 2 spell slot)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Thunderwave
  - Magic Missile
  - Mage Armour
  - Sleep
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use crowd control early with Sleep or Grease; use Fire Bolt when conserving spell slots.
    - Turn 2+: Use Thunderwave as knockback when pressured; use Magic Missile for guaranteed kill shots; use Chromatic Orb (Ice) for prone/crowd control.
  - Notes:
    - “The most important aspect of playing Gale is using Mage Armour immediately following every long rest.”
    - Early priorities: find a shield; obtain a Quarterstaff with a free spell; supplies for camps, alchemy material, and scrolls; scribe useful scrolls; swap spells and experiment.
    - Early crowd control options mentioned: sleep, grease, and firebolt combination; thunderwave as a knockout; Chromatic Orb (Ice) can knock enemies prone.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Evocation
  - Subclass Features: Sculpt Spells; Evocation Savant
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Grease
  - Chromatic Orb
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Keep Mage Armour active after long rest; use Chromatic Orb (cold) for crowd control or Grease for choke points.
    - Turn 2+: Use Fire Bolt when out of spell slots; save Thunderwave for knockback; use Magic Missile for 100% damage kill shots.
  - Notes:
    - Take both Find Familiar and Feather Fall at this level (utility / exploration).
    - Sculpt Spells: allies automatically succeed saving throws and take no damage from your Evocation spells (no “friendly fire”).
    - Evocation Savant: learning Evocation spells from scrolls costs half as much (25 gold pieces per spell level).

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Spells: Misty Step, Scorching Ray
  - Spell slots: “another level 1 spell slot and two level 2 spell slots”
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Grease
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Scorching Ray for improved single-target or multi-target damage when needed.
    - Turn 2+: Use Misty Step (bonus action teleport) defensively when you need to reposition.
  - Notes:
    - “One of the BEST defensive spells early in the game” (Misty Step) and it uses a bonus action.
    - It’s suggested to find the Amulet of Misty Step to save a spell slot.
    - Mirror Image is referenced as a powerful defensive spell you can learn.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Intelligence)
  - Cantrip: Blade Ward
  - Spells: Flaming Sphere, Mirror Image
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Grease
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
  - Flaming Sphere
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Summon Flaming Sphere as a distraction/decoy in big melee brawls (can be cast before combat).
    - Turn 2+: Rely on Scorching Ray and Chromatic Orb as main damage dealers; use Fire Bolt to conserve spell slots.
  - Notes:
    - Mirror Image is described as a “god-tier defensive spell” if dying repeatedly; it creates 3 duplicates and each increases AC by 3 until consumed.
    - Flaming Sphere becomes less effective later and can be removed for more powerful summoning abilities.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Level 3 spells (noted as when the Wizard “starts to feel very powerful”)
  - Spells: Fireball, Haste
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Grease
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Fireball
  - Haste
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Fireball for massive area damage; Evocation Sculpt Spells lets you cast AoE without worrying about damaging allies.
    - Turn 2+: Use Haste for utility to give an additional action (requires concentration; target becomes lethargic when it ends).
  - Notes:
    - “Do not cast Haste if you anticipate incoming damage” because losing concentration can cause lethargic status and “skip a turn.”

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Subclass Feature: Potent Cantrip
  - Spells: Counterspell, Glyph of Warding
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile

  - Flaming Sphere
  - Haste
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Keep Counterspell available as a reaction to shut down enemy spellcasting.
    - Turn 2+: Use Glyph of Warding as an elemental trap (choose element for damage/status utility).
  - Notes:
    - “Consider Counterspell a must-have spell to slot and always keep 1 level 3 spell or higher in reserve for its use.”
    - Resistance reduces damage in half; vulnerability increases by double.

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Level 4 spells and 1 more prepared spell
  - Spells: Ice Storm, Banishment

  - Mage Armour

    - Turn 2+: Use Banishment (concentration) as powerful single-target crowd control, used sparingly on bosses or dangerous targets.
  - Notes:
    - Flex note: “drop Chromatic Orb and Flaming Sphere for Misty Step and Mirror Image if survival is an issue.”

    - Turn 1: Continue focusing on area damage as primary goal; add Blight for single-target damage and Eldritch Blast for force damage when needed.
    - Turn 2+: Use Greater Invisibility for utility in and outside of combat.
  - Notes:
    - Spell Sniper: “reduces critical chance dice roll by 1” and lets you select a cantrip.
    - Eldritch Blast: multiple beams at higher levels (two beams at level 5; three beams at level 10), each rolled separately.

  - Flaming Sphere
  - Fireball
  - Haste
  - Counterspell
  - Ice Storm
  - Banishment
  - Conjure Elemental
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Cloudkill for large area poison damage (5–40 per turn) when it fits the fight.
    - Turn 2+: Use Conjure Elemental for an elemental ally that follows and fights without concentration (Earth Elemental is specifically preferred for stuns).
  - Notes:
    - Cloudkill is called out as something to swap in “if you are fighting something resistant to other damages.”

### Level 10

    - Turn 2+: Use Cone of Cold (8d8 cold) as conal cold damage that can proc status effects.
  - Notes:

  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Disintegrate for powerful single-target damage (50–100 force); if it reduces target to 0 hit points, it disintegrates into ash.
    - Turn 2+: Use Globe of Invulnerability (concentration) for a 3m barrier that makes creatures/objects inside it immune to all damage.
  - Notes:
    - At level 12 maximum, you “will only have access to one level 6 spell slot,” and the guide suggests seeking the Legendary Staff early in Act 3 to negate the cost of one spell (so you can use two per long rest).

## Features and Mechanics
- This build “will be all about area-based damage.”
- Evocation subclass “allows you to cast massive AoE spells without hitting allies.”
- Sculpt Spells: allies automatically succeed saving throws and take no damage from your Evocation spells (no “friendly fire”).
- Scribing: permanently learn spells from scrolls by spending gold; you must have a spell slot of the same level as the spell you are attempting to scribe; some spells (like Artistry of War) can only be learned through scribing.
- Spell slots: finite number of spells until a long rest; higher levels grant more usage and higher-tier spells.
- Cantrips: cast infinitely and don’t take spell slots.
- Concentration: if focus breaks, the spell effect ends.
- Respec: you can respec/reroll companions early; race and story cannot be adjusted; the guide suggests speaking to Withers at Camp after he’s unlocked to optimize.
- Gale location / recruit: Roadside Cliffs next to “The Purple Portal Rune on the Rock Wall,” Act 1; he is “stuck in a magical rift” at a waypoint in the Roadside Cliffs area (north of where you crashed landed).
- Human (Civil Militia): allows Gale to equip Shields; the guide notes Mage Armour + shield + quarterstaff for early AC.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Pre-Buff: Always cast Mage Armour following a long rest for additional AC and survivability.
- Bonus Action: Use bonus action for potions, jump, and even hide.
- Use Environment: Combine a fire spell with Grease and coat the area with fire damage or water with electrical damage.
- Knockback: Use a spell-like Thunderwave or Teleknises to forcibly remove melee fighters from you.
- Area Damage: You do not have friendly fire, so don’t be afraid to cast Fireball onto allies.
- Rest Constantly: Your spell slots will quickly run out after one or more fights, especially if challenging.
- Positioning: Avoid positioning close to melee fighters and spend the extra movement to retreat.
- Crowd Control: Use spells like Sleep, Hold Person, or Banishment to limit incoming attackers.
- Big Nuke: Save at least one of your spell slots in reserve for a critical moment where you need Misty Step or Counterspell.
- Use Consumables: One of the best early consumables is the Potion of Speed for double actions!
- Scribing: Frequently scribe spells and add them to you spell books; some useful spells to scribe include Wall Of Fire, Otiluke’s Freezing Sphere, and Artistry of War.

## Alternative Build Route
- Patch 8 alternative direction for Wizard: Bladesinging subclass and the Booming Blade cantrip (frontline-oriented Wizard with increased mobility and AC; Booming Blade adds melee damage that scales with level and supports hit-and-run).
- Alternative Gale Wizard build (multiclass) described:
  - Start at Level 1 with a single-level dip into Hexblade Warlock:
    - Grants: Eldritch Blast (ranged), Booming Blade (melee), proficiencies in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons; described as “much-needed defensive boost early on” and enabling a more aggressive, frontline approach.
    - The guide notes: if you prefer the traditional robed Wizard look, “don’t forget to take Mage Armour at Wizard Level 3.”
  - This multiclass path “cost you a feat at Level 12,” but the guide describes benefits as: early damage spike, improved survivability, and increased combat flexibility.
  - Level progression table (as written in the guide):
    - Level 1 Warlock: Subclass: Hexblade, Eldritch Blast, Booming Blade, Hex, Shield
    - Level 2 Wizard: Firebolt, Mage Hand, Friends, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile, Longstrider, Shield, Thunderwave, Find Familiar
    - Level 3 Wizard: Subclass: Evocation, Mage Armour, Protection from Good and Evil
    - Level 4 Wizard: Misty Step, Scorching Ray
    - Level 5 Wizard: Bursting Sinew, Mirror Image, Blur, Feat: +2 Intelligence
    - Level 6 Wizard: Fireball, Counterspell
    - Level 7 Wizard: Haste, Glyph of Warding
    - Level 8 Wizard: Conjure Minor Elemental, Ice Storm
    - Level 9 Wizard: Banishment, Blight, Shocking Grasp, Feat: Spell Sniper
    - Level 10 Wizard: Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold
    - Level 11 Wizard: Toll of the Dead, Hold Monster, Confusion
    - Level 12 Wizard: Disintegrate, Globe of Invulnerability
- Bladesinger alternative mentioned:
  - “Dip 1 level into Warlock followed by 11 levels in Bladesinging Wizard” for a “highly mobile build” while donning light armor.
  - For such a build, use Elixir of Hill Giant Strength or the Club of Hill Giant Strength in your main hand to boost Strength while keeping the recommended ability score distribution.

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 “introduces a new direction for the Wizard class,” transforming it from a vulnerable backline spellcaster into a capable frontline fighter with:
  - Bladesinging subclass (increased mobility and AC; more resilient in close quarters).
  - Booming Blade cantrip (melee damage that scales with level; hit-and-run playstyle).
- The guide states: this shift opens up new tactical options but “comes at the cost of some high-level spellcasting depth and versatility.”
- The guide also states: dipping one level into Hexblade Warlock is a strong choice for early game durability (medium armor, shields, martial weapons) and adds Eldritch Blast as a ranged option; trade-off is delayed spellcasting progression and forfeiting a feat at Level 12.

### Patch 7
- Gale received two changes in Patch 7:
  - You can now give Gale magic items from the traveller’s chest.
  - You can’t use Netherse Orb blast in the Netherbrain’s Psyche.
- The guide notes: outside of these, combat/gameplay/story remain largely the same for Gale’s character, and Patch 7’s main focus was mods (modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager).
