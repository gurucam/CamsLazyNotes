## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **ranged marksman** with a deep connection to nature, summoning loyal animal companions to aid in battle and exploration.
- Blends expert archery with wilderness survival, using spells and summons to control the battlefield.
- Plays like “**strike from afar, let your beast handle the front line, and adapt to any terrain**”—damage ramps up with multiclass synergies.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Mark targets, unleash ranged attacks, and command your animal companion** to tank and disrupt while you control from distance.

### Party role
- **Ranged DPS:** High single-target damage with Hunter's Mark and Sharpshooter.
- **Battlefield control:** Spells like Ensnaring Strike and Spiked Growth to snare enemies.
- **Utility scout:** Animal companions for exploration, spells for support.

### Pros
- Versatile ranged damage combined with summoning for extra frontline presence
- Good mobility and crowd control options
- Fun, thematic play with animal companions

### Cons
- Lower defense early on, reliant on positioning
- Limited spell slots compared to full casters
- Companion can be fragile in tough fights

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Beast Master** subclass + Summon Companion
- Level 5: **Extra Attack** (doubles your attacks)
- Level 10: **Action Surge** (extra action for burst)
- Level 11: **Battle Master** maneuvers for control

- **Fey Ancestry** (protection against crowd control)
- **Darkvision** (quality-of-life)

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **Githyanki** (Astral Knowledge, Misty Step, Martial Prodigy, Enhanced Leap).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** Longbow for ranged attacks (take from Lae'zel if needed).
- **Armor vs clothing:** Medium Armour (e.g., Githyanki Half Plate from Lae'zel).

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
