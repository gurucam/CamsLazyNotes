## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Specializes in ranged combat and survival, blending the finesse of an expert marksman with an innate connection to the natural world.
- Forms a strong bond with a loyal animal companion, which fights alongside the Ranger and aids them in various ways.
- The animal companion assists in both combat and exploration while livening up the party.

### Core Playstyle
- Deal ranged damage while summoning an animal companion to serve as a frontliner, using mobility and control to keep enemies from reaching you.

### Party Role
- Ranged damage dealer.
- Battlefield control (snaring / debuffing / crowd control).
- Companion-driven front line support (distractions, stuns, and soaking pressure).

### Pros
- Versatile and exciting playstyle that can be highly rewarding.
- Excels in ranged combat, control of the battlefield, and adapting to various situations.
- Summon helps do damage, stun opponents, and provide distractions (especially strong at level 12).

### Cons
- Rangers have great mobility but not a lot of defense (medium armour is vital early).
- Limited spells and spell slots, so they should be used when needed most.
- Ensnaring Strike is “VERY costly” (action + bonus action + concentration).

### Power Spikes
- Level 3: Beast Master subclass (summon companion).
- Level 4: Sharpshooter feat (+10 damage, -5 to attack roll; ignores High Ground rules).
- Level 5: Extra Attack; Companion’s Bond; access to stronger battlefield control.
- Level 10: Action Surge (extra action once per fight).
- Level 11: Battle Master subclass (Manoeuvres + Superiority Dice for crowd control).
- Level 12: +2 Dexterity feat (main ability to 20).

  - Notes:

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Mobility: Rangers are very mobile, so use this to your advantage in combat. Use high movement offensively and defensively to position for better attacks and to get out of danger.
- Stealth: is a very useful skill for rangers, as it allows you to sneak up on enemies and get the drop on them (especially useful in boss fights).
- Spell Timing: Rangers have a variety of spells that can be very useful in combat; use them wisely to buff your allies, debuff your enemies, and deal damage, but know they are limited and should be used when needed most.
- Prepare: Recharge spells with long rest; always have potions, elemental arrows, and speed potions ready.
- Environment: If you’re overwhelmed, Dash to create more movement, line of sight of the enemy, and get in stealth; this will allow you to lose aggro and hopefully open with a damage ability or heal.
- Exploit vulnerabilities: Use different arrows to exploit enemy weaknesses.
- Beast Master Ranger Gameplay & Priorities:
  - At the beginning of BG3, equip a Longbow and Medium Armour.
  - The easiest way to get a good set of armour and weapons is by taking them from Lae’zel (Githyanki Half Plate with 15 Armour Class (AC) and the heavy crossbow) if you don’t intend to use her.
  - Look to acquire Elixir of Hill Giant Strength, Potion of Speed, and Oil of Accuracy consumables; these three consumables stack, allowing for massive damage.
  - Overall priority:
    - Complete Prologue
    - Recruit Companions
    - Unlock Withers, respec companions to proper class/ability score
    - Collect the Necromancy of Thay (important in Act 3)
    - Reach Druid Grove
    - Sell, Stock up, complete quests
    - Unlock summons, Scratch, Shovel
    - Progress to level 5
    - Reach Underdark and Grymforge
    - Acquire Titanstring Bow or Bow of Banshee
    - Check all Permanent Bonuses in Act 1 and the best Gear

## Alternative Build Route
Our alternative Ranger build will eschew the Beast Master subclass for the more powerful Gloom Stalker Ranger. Additionally, we’ll multiclass sooner, taking Rogue at Level 6 before reaching Fighter at Level 10. This option will boost your overall defense and survivability, as well as the useful Action Surge. Additionally, taking the Champion subclass at level 12 will give you the Improved Critical Hit passive feature, which will stack with other sources to lower the number you need to roll for a critical hit.

- Level 1: Ranger — Wasteland Wanderer: Cold, Bounty Hunter
- Level 2: Ranger — Fighting Style: Archery; Spells: Hunter’s Mark, Longstrider
- Level 3: Ranger — Subclass: Gloom Stalker; Spell: Ensnaring Strike
- Level 4: Ranger — Feat: Sharpshooter
- Level 5: Ranger — Lesser Restoration
- Level 6: Rogue — Skill Proficiency: Acrobatics; Skill Expertise: Sleight of Hand, Stealth
- Level 7: Rogue — Cunning Actions
- Level 8: Rogue — Subclass: Assassin
- Level 9: Rogue — Feat: Ability Improvement (Dexterity)
- Level 10: Fighter — Fighting Style: Defense
- Level 11: Fighter — Action Surge
- Level 12: Fighter — Subclass: Champion

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 introduced new subclasses for every one of the game’s 12 core classes.
- Swarmkeeper Ranger revolves around the unique ability Prey’s Scent, which transforms how Hunter’s Mark functions, opening the door to new tactical strategies and damage combos.
- Despite Swarmkeeper’s interesting potential, it may not be the best choice for every scenario.
- The Beast Master Ranger remains a viable subclass, but an alternate build that includes a mix of Rogue and Fighter via multiclassing is included.

### Patch 7
- The Beast Master subclass and Ranger class received no changes to combat and gameplay in this new content update.
- The overall focus of Patch 7 was adding mods and new endings with more honour mode boss actions.
- The game now features a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager, allowing players to create and install mods directly within the game.
- This Beast Master Ranger build guide remains unchanged for Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 7.
