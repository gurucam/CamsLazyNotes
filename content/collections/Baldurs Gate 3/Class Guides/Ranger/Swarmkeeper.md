## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **nature-bonded archer** commanding swarms of ethereal creatures (like Flurry of Moths) to amplify attacks, blind foes, and teleport for superior positioning.
- Plays like “**ambush from shadows, mark prey, and overwhelm with swarm-enhanced ranged barrages**”—versatile damage types and mobility shine with multiclass burst.
- Thematic wilderness guardian turned spectral swarm master, adapting Hunter's Mark via Prey’s Scent for elemental flexibility.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Stealth initiation → Hunter’s Mark → Sharpshooter volleys with swarm effects** for damage, debuffs, and repositions, exploding via multiclass Sneak Attack, crits, and Action Surge.

### Party role
- **Ranged DPS:** High single-target burst with Hunter's Mark, Colossus Slayer-like swarm procs, and crit chains.
- **Battlefield control:** Blind/shock/push via swarms, Ensnaring Strike for lockdown.
- **Ambush scout:** Stealth superiority, mobility for exploration and first strikes.

### Pros
- Incredible versatility (damage types, utility via Prey’s Scent swarm swaps)
- Excellent mobility and ranged safety with teleport/blind options
- Massive burst from multiclass synergies (Assassin crits + Action Surge)

### Cons
- Multiclass delays Ranger spells/features
- Setup-dependent (stealth/Hunter’s Mark concentration vulnerable)
- Weaker pure magic utility than full casters

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Swarmkeeper** + Gathered Swarm/Prey’s Scent (swarm online)
- Level 5: **Extra Attack** (doubles output)
- Level 8: **Assassin** (ambush crits + full actions)
- Level 11: **Action Surge** (quad attacks)

---

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Wood Elf
- **Class:** Ranger
- **Subclass:** Swarmkeeper
- **Background:** Urchin
- **Skills:** Animal Handling, Insight, Survival
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 17 / CON 16 / INT 8 / WIS 14 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Wood Elf)
- **Longbow proficiency** + highest movement speed for kiting/positioning
- **Fey Ancestry** (advantage vs. charm, immune to sleep magic)
- **Darkvision** + stealth in nature (quality-of-life for ambushes)

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **Githyanki** (Misty Step, Mage Hand, Enhanced Leap); **Duergar Dwarf** (Invisibility, Enlarge for melee hybrid).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** Longbow primary (Titanstring Bow Act 1 scales with STR elixirs).
- **Armor vs clothing:** Medium armor (Graceful Cloth early for AC/crit immunity).
- **Back-bar ranged:** Shield + STR weapon (Club of Hill Giant Strength) for bow scaling.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Complete prologue, recruit companions (Lae’zel, Shadowheart, Gale), unlock Withers respec.
- Rush **Titanstring Bow** (Zhentarim Hideout) + **Club of Hill Giant Strength** (Arcane Tower).
- Hit **Level 5** fast (Extra Attack); craft Adamantine gear; stock elixirs/poisons.
