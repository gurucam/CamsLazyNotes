## Features and Mechanics
- The Swarmkeeper Ranger build is unique due to Prey’s Scent to change Hunter’s Mark effects.
- You can create a powerful synergy by combining Act 2’s Resonance Stone and Moth Attacks to increase overall Psychic damage.
- Prey’s Scent allows you to passively swap between bonuses with Hunter’s Mark, like extra piercing damage, teleportation, or Psychic damage.
- The Ranger remains a versatile class that can play effectively at range or in melee, with limited spell casting, stealth benefits, and a variety of armor and weapon proficiencies.
- The main downside is you need to multiclass for optimal damage and lose the turn-one utility of the Gloom Stalker.

- Different enemies may be susceptible or vulnerable to damage types like Psychic or Lightning.

- Crafting – Elixirs and potions are crucial, so be sure to buy crafting materials whenever trading.
- Reach Level 6 – Complete as many early-game quests as possible to hit level 6, where your power spikes significantly.
- Sell Regularly – Limited carrying capacity means you should sell excess items often and store valuable but unused gear in your traveler’s chest.

- Consider Illithid Powers – Though they may alter your appearance, these abilities provide significant power boosts.
- Oils & Elixirs – Use both coatings/oils and elixirs in combat to maximize their combined benefits.

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8

- One of the most impactful additions in Patch 8 is the introduction of new subclasses, one for each of the game’s 12 core classes.
- For the Ranger, this comes in the form of the Swarmkeeper, a subclass that brings a fresh, tactical twist to the traditional playstyle.
- At the heart of the Swarmkeeper’s kit is Prey’s Scent, an ability that redefines how Hunter’s Mark operates, enhancing its utility and damage potential.
- The Swarmkeeper shines when you combine it with Moth Attacks and the Resonance Stone found in Act 2, creating a powerful synergy that ramps up your Psychic damage output significantly.
- Otherwise, the Ranger remains unchanged.
