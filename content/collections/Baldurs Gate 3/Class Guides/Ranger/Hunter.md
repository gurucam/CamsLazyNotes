- Stealth: Sneak up on enemies and get the drop on them; especially useful in boss fights to deal damage before the enemy knows you’re there.
- Spell Timing: Use spells wisely to buff allies, debuff enemies, and deal damage; they are limited and should be used when needed most.
- Prepare: Recharge spells with long rest; always have potions, elemental arrows, and speed potions ready.
- Environment: If overwhelmed, Dash to create more movement, line of sight of the enemy, and get in stealth to lose aggro and hopefully open with a damage ability or heal.
- Exploit vulnerabilities: Use different arrows to exploit enemy weaknesses (examples: fire arrows vs fire-vulnerable enemies; acid arrows vs foes with high armor).
