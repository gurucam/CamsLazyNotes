## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A versatile wilderness warrior specializing in tracking and slaying specific prey, blending archery prowess with tactical spells.
- Plays like “**snipe from range, mark and burst down targets, control the field**”—damage surges with Extra Attack and Sharpshooter online.
- Adaptable to various foes through Hunter's Prey choices, with a focus on mobility and survival.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Apply Hunter's Mark, unleash ranged attacks with Sharpshooter, and use control spells** to lock down enemies while maintaining distance.

### Party role
- **Ranged DPS:** Consistent high damage from bows, amplified against marked targets.
- **Battlefield control:** Spells like Ensnaring Strike and Spiked Growth to hinder groups.
- **Utility expert:** Disarming, lockpicking, and exploration aids from class features.

### Pros
- High mobility and ranged dominance
- Versatile against different enemy types
- Combines damage with some spell utility

### Cons
- No heavy armor proficiency
- Limited spell slots
- Weak in charisma-based dialogues

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Hunter** subclass + Colossus Slayer
- Level 5: **Extra Attack** (multiplies damage output)
- Level 10: **Action Surge** (extra action for bursts)
- Level 11: **Battle Master** maneuvers for added control
