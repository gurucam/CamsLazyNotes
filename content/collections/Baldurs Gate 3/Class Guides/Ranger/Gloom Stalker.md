## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Increased focus on stealth, darkness, and ambushing enemies.
- Feels incredibly powerful owing to several features, the most important being its extra attack on turn one.
- Can start combat from stealth to cause the Surprised condition and dish out a ridiculous amount of damage before the enemy can retaliate.

### Core Playstyle
- Start fights from stealth to open with burst damage on turn one, then use ranged weapon pressure and mobility to stay safe while controlling who can reach you.

### Party Role
- Turn-one burst damage / opener (high initiative, extra first-turn attack).
- Ranged damage dealer with weapon and armour proficiencies.
- Control and adaptability via limited spellcasting and battlefield tools.

### Pros
- Extra attack on turn one (Dread Ambusher).
- High initiative and stealth/invisibility tools (Dread Ambusher + Umbral Shroud + Superior Darkvision).
- Retains Ranger strengths: weapon and armour proficiencies, Extra Attack (level 5), and spell casting.

### Cons
- Don’t have heavy armor proficiency at the start.
- Require consumable arrows for maximum damage.
- At the beginning of the game, the Rogue will have more utility with stealth and lockpicking.

### Power Spikes
- Level 3: Dread Ambusher, Superior Darkvision, Umbral Shroud.
- Level 5: Extra Attack (and free Misty Step).
- Level 7: Iron Mind (proficiency in Wisdom and Intelligence Saving Throws).
- Level 11: Stalker’s Flurry.

## Illithid Powers
- Luck of the Far Realms: When you make a successful Attack Roll against a foe, you can change that hit into a Critical Hit.
- Cull the Weak: When you bring a creature down to fewer hit points than your number of evolved Illithid powers, it dies and all nearby creatures take 1-4 Psychic damage.

- Blackhole: Area-based suck-in that slows targets.
- Repulsor: Massive area knockback that can hit friendlies.
- Charm: “This is the priority power you want to obtain because you can force enemies to attack something else.”

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Mobility: Rangers are very mobile, so use this to your advantage in combat. Use high movement offensively and defensively to position for better attacks and to get out of danger.
- Stealth: is a very useful skill for rangers, as it allows you to sneak up on enemies and get the drop on them. This can be especially useful in boss fights, as it can allow you to deal a lot of damage before the enemy even knows you’re there.
- Spell Timing: Rangers have a variety of spells that can be very useful in combat. Use them wisely to buff your allies, debuff your enemies, and deal damage but know they are limited and should be used when needed most.
- Prepare: Baldur’s Gate 3 is a very challenging game, so it’s important to be prepared for anything. Make sure to recharge spells with long rest, always have potions, elemental arrows, and speed potions ready.
- Environment: Use the environment to your advantage. If you’re overwhelmed, Dash to create more movement, line of sight of the enemy, and get in stealth. This will allow you to lose aggro and hopefully open with a damage ability or heal.
- Exploit vulnerabilities: Rangers have access to a variety of ammunition types. Use different arrows to exploit enemy weaknesses. For example, fire arrows can be effective against enemies vulnerable to fire damage, while acid arrows can be useful against foes with high armor.

## Alternative Build Route
- Summary: Similar to the main recommendation, with the significant exception of multiclassing into Rogue starting at Level 5, and investing into Fighter at the end to boost defense/survivability and gain Action Surge. Taking the Champion subclass at level 12 gives Improved Critical Hit, which stacks with other sources to lower the number you need to roll for a critical hit.
- Level plan:
  - Level 1: Ranger — Wasteland Wanderer: Cold, Bounty Hunter
  - Level 2: Ranger — Fighting Style: Archery; Spells: Hunter’s Mark, Longstrider
  - Level 3: Ranger — Subclass: Gloom Stalker; Spell: Ensnaring Strike
  - Level 4: Ranger — Feat: Sharpshooter
  - Level 5: Ranger — Lesser Restoration
  - Level 6: Rogue — Skill Proficiency: Acrobatics; Skill Expertise: Sleight of Hand, Stealth
  - Level 7: Rogue — Cunning Actions
  - Level 8: Rogue — Subclass: Assassin
  - Level 9: Rogue — Feat: Ability Improvement (Dexterity)
  - Level 10: Fighter — Fighting Style: Defense
  - Level 11: Fighter — Action Surge
  - Level 12: Fighter — Subclass: Champion

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- “The most significant change to character builds in Patch 8 of Baldur’s Gate 3 was the introduction of new subclasses. Each of the 12 core classes were given an additional subclass option.”
- For Ranger: new subclass is the Swarmkeeper; special ability Prey’s Scent enhances Hunter’s Mark in powerful and distinctive ways.
- Notable synergy described: Resonance Stone from Act 2 with Moth Attacks, dramatically increasing Psychic damage output.
- “However, despite the interesting utility of the Swarmkeeper, we still recommend the Gloom Stalker as the best subclass for the Ranger.”
- “Additionally, we’ve offered an alternative build below, which gives you some multiclass options to use for a powerful Ranger build.”

### Patch 7
- “The Gloom Stalker subclass and Ranger class received zero changes to combat and gameplay.”
- “The overall focus of Patch 7 was adding mods and new endings with more honour mode boss actions.”
- “The game now features a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager…”
- “This best Gloom Stalker Ranger Build Guide remained unchanged for Patch 7 of Baldur’s Gate 3.”
