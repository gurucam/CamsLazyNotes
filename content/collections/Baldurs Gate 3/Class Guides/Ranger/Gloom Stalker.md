## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A stealthy ambusher lurking in shadows, specializing in surprise attacks and burst damage on the first turn.
- Plays like "**initiate from stealth, unleash devastating ranged volleys, and control the battlefield**"—damage explodes with Extra Attack and Sharpshooter.
- Retains ranger versatility with spells for utility, control, and survival in the wilderness.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Stealth to surprise enemies, apply Hunter's Mark, and unleash multiple ranged attacks** while using spells for crowd control and mobility.

### Party role
- **Ranged DPS:** High burst and sustained damage with bows and arrows.
- **Battlefield control:** Spells like Ensnaring Strike and Spiked Growth to snare and hinder foes.
- **Utility scout:** Stealth, perception, and summons for exploration and ambushes.

### Pros
- Exceptional first-turn burst damage from stealth
- Versatile with spells, mobility, and resistances
- Strong initiative and survivability in darkness

### Cons
- No heavy armor proficiency early on
- Relies on consumable arrows for max damage
- Feels slow before level 5 Extra Attack

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Gloom Stalker** subclass + Dread Ambusher
- Level 5: **Extra Attack** (doubles attacks)
- Level 8: **+2 Dexterity** feat (improved accuracy)
- Level 11: **Stalker's Flurry** (free attack on miss)

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **Githyanki** (Astral Knowledge, Misty Step, Martial Prodigy, Enhanced Leap).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** Longbow (ranged) for primary attacks; take from Lae'zel if needed.
- **Armor vs clothing:** Medium armour (e.g., Githyanki Half Plate from Lae'zel for 15 AC).
- **Back-bar ranged:** Keep a secondary weapon or shield for flexibility.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Complete the prologue, recruit companions, reach Druid Grove.
- Sell/stock up, complete quests, unlock Withers for respec.
- Progress to level 5 quickly (Extra Attack).
- Reach Underdark/Grymforge, acquire Titanstring Bow or Bow of Banshee.
