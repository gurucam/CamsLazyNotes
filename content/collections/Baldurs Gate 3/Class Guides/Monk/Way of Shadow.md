## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A highly mobile **stealth striker** who uses the shadows and darkness to appear, strike multiple times, and disappear before enemies can react.
- The build focuses on **unarmed damage** amplified by **Tavern Brawler**, coupled with high **Mobility** and **Evasion** for defense.
- Combines the Monk’s core of high movement and multiple attacks with **Shadow Arts** for powerful crowd control and stealth options.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- An agile striker who uses darkness and shadow powers to reposition, gain advantage, and deliver numerous powerful unarmed strikes to eliminate key targets quickly.

### Party role
- **High Damage Striker:** Uses bonus actions for extra attacks (Flurry of Blows) or movement (Step of the Wind).
- **Crowd Control:** Can use Stunning Strike and Shadow Arts to lock down priority threats.
- **Scout/Stealth:** Excellent at scouting, infiltration, and avoiding detection due to innate stealth proficiencies and Shadow Arts.

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)

- **Pure Shadow Monk (1 → 12)**
  - Sticking purely to Monk 12 provides the most Ki points, and access to all of the class's high-level features.
  - Allows for a final Feat/ASI choice (e.g., **Mobile**, if desired, although movement is already high).
