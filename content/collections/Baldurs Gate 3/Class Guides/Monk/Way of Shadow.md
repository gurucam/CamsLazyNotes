## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- A stealthy and evasive Monk subclass that focuses on using the shadows to its advantage.
- Keeps the Monk premise with high mobility and multiple attacks, but allows for extra spells and crowd control options.
- Extra stealth and invisibility options, with shadow-themed teleporting and ambush tools.

### Core Playstyle
- Fight up close with unarmed attacks, using darkness/obscured areas for stealth, invisibility, and shadow teleporting to set up advantaged melee strikes.

### Party Role
- Melee-focused damage dealer with high mobility and multiple attacks.
- Single-target control through stuns and shadow-based positioning.
- Stealth/infiltration utility via Shadow Arts (Hide, Pass Without Trace, Darkness, Silence).

### Pros
- Very high mobility (Unarmoured Movement and later Improved Unarmoured Movement).
- Strong single-target crowd control (Stunning Strike) plus stealth/invisibility tools (Cloak of Shadows).
- Scales unarmed/Monk attacks via Dexterity (Dexterous Attacks) and can leverage Strength via Tavern Brawler + Elixirs.

### Cons
- Ki points are a limited resource and must be managed (replenish on short rest).
- Clothing-focused gameplay (wearing armour destroys mobility and interacts poorly with Unarmored Defense).
- From levels 9 to 12, Monk effectiveness “falls off dramatically,” prompting multiclassing recommendations.

### Power Spikes
- Level 3: Way of Shadow subclass (Shadow Arts + Minor Illusion).
- Level 4: Tavern Brawler feat (and +1 Constitution) + increased importance of Elixirs of Hill Giant Strength.
- Level 5: Extra Attack + Stunning Strike + Cloak of Shadows.
- Level 6: Shadow Step (teleport + Advantage on next melee attack).
- Level 11: Thief (Fast Hands) for an additional Bonus Action.

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Ki
  - Unarmored Defense
  - Dexterous Attacks
  - Flurry of Blows
  - Deft Strikes
  - Unarmed Strike
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use an action for a weapon attack (or unarmed) and Flurry of Blows as a bonus action.
    - Turn 2+: Continue mixing action attacks with bonus-action unarmed pressure.
  - Notes:
    - Wear clothing (not armour) due to Unarmored Defense (Wisdom modifier added to Armour Class).
    - Attacks with Monk Weapons and unarmed attacks scale with Dexterity instead of Strength if Dexterity is higher.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Unarmoured Movement (movement speed increases by 3m while not wearing armor or using a shield)
  - Patient Defense (bonus action + Ki Point: Attack Rolls against you have Disadvantage; Advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws)
  - Step of the Wind: Dash (bonus action + Ki point: Double movement speed; Jump no longer requires a bonus action)
  - Step of the Wind: Disengage (bonus action + Ki point: Disengage; Jump no longer requires a bonus action)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use action attacks; use Step of the Wind (Dash/Disengage) or Patient Defense as needed.
    - Turn 2+: Keep bonus actions flexible (mobility or defense) while maintaining attacks.
  - Notes:
    - Clothing remains important because Unarmoured Movement is tied to not wearing armor.
    - “Combat remains the same… except throwing in a Patient Defensive when you need protection or a big hit against an enemy.”

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Way of Shadow
  - Minor Illusion (Cantrip)
  - Shadow Arts: Hide (bonus action)
  - Shadow Arts: Pass Without Trace
  - Shadow Arts: Darkness
  - Shadow Arts: Darkvision
  - Shadow Arts: Silence
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Shadow Arts: Hide (bonus action) to set up safety or a strong opener from stealth.
    - Turn 2+: Use Pass Without Trace for party stealth utility; use Silence to shut down spellcasters; use Darkness to control space.
  - Notes:
    - Shadow Arts: Hide is a bonus action (not an action).
    - Darkvision is described as vital if playing a non-Darkvision racial choice (limited light reduces chance to hit).
    - “The class excels after level 5.”

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Slow Fall (reaction: gain Resistance to Falling damage)
  - Feat: Tavern Brawler (+1 Strength or Constitution; guide selects +1 Constitution to reach 16)
  - Ki Point
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Maintain unarmed pressure; leverage Tavern Brawler scaling with Strength.
    - Turn 2+: Use Elixirs of Hill Giant Strength as a buff for hard fights after a long rest.
  - Notes:
    - Tavern Brawler: Strength Modifier added twice to damage and Attack Rolls for unarmed/improvised/throwing.
    - “At this point, Elixirs of Hill Giant Strength becomes very important to add a ton of damage.”

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Extra Attack
  - Stunning Strike (Melee)
  - Stunning Strike (Unarmed)
  - Ki Point
  - Cloak of Shadows (subclass feature)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Stunning Strike as an action to stun/crowd control, then follow up with Flurry of Blows as a bonus action.
    - Turn 2+: Use Extra Attack to increase action-based output; repeat stuns/pressure as Ki allows.
  - Notes:
    - Cloak of Shadows: become Invisible if you are obscured (requires shadows/darkened areas).
    - Can combo Cloak of Shadows with Darkness to get into invisibility or seek obscure areas.
    - Use Ki Points sparingly at this level (“they are so few”).

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Improved Unarmoured Movement (movement speed increases by 4.5m while not wearing armor or using a shield)
  - Ki Empowered Strikes (unarmed attacks count as magical to overcome Resistance/Immunity to non-magical damage)
  - Shadow Step (subclass feature: teleport from shadow to shadow; afterwards, Advantage on next melee Attack Roll)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Darkness / obscured areas to enable Shadow Step positioning.
    - Turn 2+: Shadow Step to gain Advantage on next melee Attack Roll and continue pressure in/out of shadows.
  - Notes:
    - The guide describes the premise as using darkness/obscured areas to teleport and gain Advantage (roll two d20 rather than one).
    - Synergy called out: Darkness, Cloak of Shadows, then Shadow Step.
    - Ending Act 1 note: consider collecting Grymforge Adamantine crafting components before moving on to Act 2 (Mithral, Mould, and Craft items).

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Evasion (no damage on successful Dexterity Saving Throw where half damage would normally apply; half damage on fail)
  - Stillness of Mind (if Charmed or Frightened, automatically cast Stillness of Mind to remove the condition)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Same offensive setup as prior levels.
    - Turn 2+: Rely on improved defensive tools while continuing standard Monk actions/bonus actions.
  - Notes:
    - “The gameplay remains the same at this level, just with more defensive capabilities.”

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (increase Dexterity by +2)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue the same Monk attack pattern; higher Dexterity improves damage and chance to hit.
    - Turn 2+: Keep using mobility/stealth tools as needed.
  - Notes:
    - “Ability improvements are always solid choices and it’s harder to increase Dexterity than say Strength due to consumables.”
    - “Hitting 18 in Dexterity means big damage, a higher percentage to hit, and zero complex gameplay mechanics.”

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Multiclass to Rogue
  - Skill Proficiencies: Acrobatics and Sleight of Hand
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Begin leveraging Rogue tools alongside Monk action/bonus-action economy.
    - Turn 2+: Build toward Thief for an additional Bonus Action (Fast Hands).
  - Notes:
    - The guide states Monk effectiveness “falls off dramatically” from levels 9 to 12 and recommends multiclassing to Rogue at this point.
    - It notes Monk favors bonus actions, and combat revolves around action and bonus action resources.

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Rogue (second level): Cunning Actions
    - Cunning Action Hide
    - Cunning Action Dash
    - Cunning Action Disengage
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Cunning Action: Dash as a bonus action to cover massive distance with high movement speed.
    - Turn 2+: Use Cunning Action (Hide/Dash/Disengage) to reposition while preserving action attacks.
  - Notes:
    - The guide highlights the benefit of Dash being a bonus action rather than an action.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Rogue Subclass: Thief
  - Fast Hands (Gain an additional Bonus Action)
  - Second-Story Work (mastered falling; gain Resistance to Falling damage)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use multiple bonus actions for extra attacks/utility alongside Monk action attacks.
    - Turn 2+: Continue leveraging improved mobility and bonus-action economy.
  - Notes:
    - “Now you can use multiple bonus actions and expect the damage and mobility to improve even further.”

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Dexterity)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Same core gameplay; “striking harder and better chance to land attacks.”
    - Turn 2+: Continue combining action attacks with multiple bonus actions (from Thief) for additional attacks/utility.
  - Notes:
    - The guide’s final build callout: eight Monk levels and four Rogue levels.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Mobility: Monks have one of the highest movement speeds for a melee build so take advantage of it offensively and defensively.
2. Bonus Actions: make sure to use your bonus action every turn for an extra attack or utility.
3. Stuns: the Monk excels at single-target crowd control, and in later levels, you can make multiple attempts.
4. Armor: make sure to use clothing not light, medium, or heavy armor as it’ll destroy your mobility.
5. Consumables: Using a potion of speed gives you a secondary action for 3 turns and is very helpful.
6. Wholeness of Body: use this skill early during long-duration fights for 3 extra turns of bonus action.
7. Ki Points: make sure to refresh these points after combat so you don’t run out during each encounter.
8. Opening Turn: attempt to reach a target for attack or use bonus action for double movement speed.
9. Throw: you can throw objects when not in melee range to help keep damage high.
10. Elemental Damage: Make sure to change your unarmed elemental damage based on the fight.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative build concept: choose Way of the Open Hand and later combine it with Rogue for a highly mobile, strong fighter, and also pick up levels in Fighter for Action Surge.
- The guide states: you lose one feat, but gain Action Surge (once per Short Rest) for a second string of attacks, especially powerful if combined with a Potion of Speed or Hasten.

Alternative progression listed:
- Level 1: Monk — Ki, Unarmored Defense, Dexterous Attacks
- Level 2: Monk — Unarmoured Movement, Patient Defense, Step of the Wind
- Level 3: Monk — Subclass: Way of the Open Hand
- Level 4: Monk — Feat: Tavern Brawler
- Level 5: Monk — Extra Attack, Stunning Strike
- Level 6: Monk — Improved Unarmoured Movement, Ki Empowered Strike, Wholeness of Body

- Level 8: Rogue — Cunning Actions
- Level 9: Rogue — Subclass: Thief
