## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Fun unique way to play the Monk.
- Revolves around erratic movement and disorienting enemies.
- Great role-playing potential that can make for some humorous campaigns, especially with friends.

### Core Playstyle
- Drink alcohol to restore Ki once per day, then use Ki attacks to punch, stun, and inflict Drunk while staying mobile and hard to pin down.

### Party Role
- Frontline melee damage dealer that excels at unarmed combat.
- Crowd control and disorientation via stuns and Drunk status effects.
- Highly mobile skirmisher that closes distance quickly and repositions with bonus-action movement tools.

### Pros
- High Damage
- Not Gear Dependent
- Unique Debuff (Drunk)

### Cons
- Weaker than Open Hand
- Susceptible to Magic
- Needs Multiclass

- Level 5: Extra Attack + Stunning Strike.
- Level 7–9: Rogue multiclass to Thief for extra bonus action (Fast Hands) and “4 attacks per turn”.

    - Turn 2+: Continue pairing an action-based attack with bonus-action strikes as the central theme.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Consume alcohol found by looting crates or buying from taverns to restore your Ki resource once per day.
- Use your Ki attacks like Drunken Technique and Intoxicating Strike to stun and inflict Drunk on enemies.
- Always leave 1.5 meters of movement and one Ki point as you end your turn (useful for a Reaction strike or if you get knocked prone, you can pop back up).
- Use the Tavern Brawler feat to double your Strength modifier attack roll and damage for unarmed strikes.
- Multiclass three levels into Rogue for Fast Hands, giving you an extra bonus action per turn.
- Consume an Elixir of Hill Giant Strength or Cloud Giant Elixir to boost Strength, increasing your damage further via Tavern Brawler feat.
- In Act 3, get the Nyrulna trident so you can throw the weapon and have it automatically returns to you.

## Alternative Build Route
- Description: Start with the Way of the Open Hand subclass instead. Later add Rogue for a mobile, hard-hitting warrior. Finally dip into Fighter for a couple of levels. This means losing one feat, but you gain Action Surge (extra action once per Short Rest). “Consume a Potion of Speed, and you’ll be able to unleash a devastating second round of attacks.”

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 introduced significant changes to the Monk class, including a series of balance tweaks and the addition of a brand-new subclass: the Way of the Drunken Master.
- The Way of the Drunken Master “brings a fresh, somewhat unpredictable playstyle that revolves around erratic movement and disorienting enemies.”
- The subclass “amps up a Monk’s mobility and crowd control,” with examples called out as “Drunken Technique” for evasive maneuvers and “Life of the Party” making them harder to pin down during battle.
- Patch 8 of Baldur’s Gate 3 releases 12 new subclasses with Drunken Master Monk being one of the strongest.
- Patch 8 added more spells and cantrips only useful if the Monk multiclass or uses magic initiate feats.
