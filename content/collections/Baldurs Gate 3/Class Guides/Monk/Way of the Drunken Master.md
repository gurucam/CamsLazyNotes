## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A chaotic, slippery brawler who turns “being drunk” into a combat engine: you debuff targets, recover Ki with alcohol (once per day), and keep fights messy with mobility + reaction tricks.
- Plays like “**tag targets, overwhelm with extra actions, and keep moving**”—you ramp up hard once you add Rogue (Thief) for extra bonus actions.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Close fast, punch multiple times per turn, inflict Drunk on targets, and snowball with extra bonus actions while staying hard to pin down.**

### Party role
- **Frontline striker:** high single-target damage with repeated unarmed attacks.
- **Debuff / disruptor:** inflicts Drunk and plays around reaction value + movement.
- **Mobile finisher:** excels at reaching priority targets and cleaning up enemies.

### Pros
- High damage with multiple attacks per turn
- Not gear dependent compared to weapon builds
- Unique debuff (Drunk) + strong mobility

### Cons
- Weaker than Open Hand
- Susceptible to incoming magic attacks
- Needs multiclass to make the most out of the subclass

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: Drunken Master online (drunk immunity, Ki refresh via alcohol once per day, Drunken Technique)
- Level 4: Tavern Brawler
- Level 5: Extra Attack + access to stuns
- Level 9: Thief (extra bonus action) for big turn economy jump
- Level 10+: stacking AC/attack vs Drunk targets and closing out the build

---

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Githyanki
- **Class:** Monk
- **Subclass:** Way of the Drunken Master
- **Background:** Charlatan
- **Skills:** Athletics, Acrobatics
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 17 / CON 15 / INT 8 / WIS 16 / CHA 8

### Race notes (why Githyanki)
- Githyanki is recommended because you gain movement abilities that help reach targets on turn one.
- Secondary choice mentioned: Wood Half-Elf (more movement per turn).
- Another option mentioned: Asmodeus Tiefling (fire resistance and Hellish Rebuke).

### Ability score notes
- Dexterity boosts unarmed damage, while Constitution increases health.
- At level 4, take Tavern Brawler and raise Constitution to 16.
- Most damage comes from maximizing Strength with the Elixir of Hill Giant Strength (sets it to 21)—hence not investing in Strength initially.
- Make sure to get Auntie Ethel’s permanent bonus in Act 1 to make Dexterity an even number.

### Recommended companions
- Shadowheart (Cleric – Life) – buffs, heals, and stuns enemies.
- Gale (Wizard – Evocation) – area damage caused by fire and ice.
- Karlach (Barbarian – Berserker) – frontline attention-getter and high damage-dealer.

## Level-by-level progression (Monk 1 → 6, Rogue 1 → 3, Monk 7 → 9)
> Default loop: spend your action to attack, then use bonus actions for extra unarmed pressure. Use alcohol once per day to recover Ki between combats, and use your subclass kit to keep enemies debuffed and you hard to punish.

### Level 1 — Monk 1
**Gain**
- Ki: resource points to use special Monk attacks can be replenished on short rest.
- Unarmored Defense: While not wearing armour, you add your Wisdom Modifier to your Armour Class.
- Dexterous Attacks: Attacks with Monk Weapons and unarmed attacks scale with your Dexterity instead of your Strength if your Dexterity is higher.
- Deft Strikes: Attacks with Monk Weapons and unarmed attacks deal 1~4 Bludgeoning damage, unless their normal damage is higher.
- Unarmed Strike: After attacking with a Monk Weapon or while unarmed, you can make another unarmed attack as a bonus action.

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Action: attack (unarmed or monk weapon) → Bonus action: unarmed follow-up.
- Stay in clothing (not armour) to benefit from Unarmored Defense.

### Level 2 — Monk 2
**Gain**
- Unarmoured Movement: Your movement speed increases by 3m while you are not wearing armor or using a shield.
- Patient Defense: using a bonus action and a Ki Point, Attack Rolls against you have Disadvantage, and you have Advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws.
- Step of the Wind: Dash (Action): using a bonus action and a Ki point, Double your movement speed. Jump no longer requires a bonus action.
- Step of the Wind: Disengage (Action): using a bonus action and a Ki point, Retreat to safety by Disengaging. Jump no longer requires a bonus action.

**Play style (Level 2)**
- If you must cross distance: use Step of the Wind to close and still attack.
- If you expect big incoming hits: use Patient Defense to stay safe while still keeping pressure.

### Level 3 — Monk 3 (Way of the Drunken Master)
**Gain**
- Martial Arts: Deft Strikes: Damage from attacks with Unarmed/Monk Weapons deal 1d6 Bludgeoning (previously 1d4) unless their normal damage is higher.
- Deflect Missiles: Use your reaction to reduce the damage from a ranged weapon attack.
- Cheeky Tipple: You are Immune to the negative effects of being Drunk. Once per day, when you drink alcohol, you regain half your Ki Points (rounded down).
- Drunken Performance: You gain Proficiency in Performance.
- Drunken Technique: Punch twice in quick succession and grant yourself an additional 3 meters movement and the benefits of Disengage.

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Use Drunken Technique for bonus-action pressure + repositioning (extra movement + Disengage).
- Between combats (once per day): drink alcohol to regain half your Ki Points.

### Level 4 — Monk 4
**Gain**
- Slow Fall: When you fall, you can use your reaction to gain Resistance to Falling damage.
- Tavern Brawler (feat): Increase your Strength or Constitution by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Intoxicating Strike: Hit a creature with your bare fists and possibly get them Drunk.

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Increase Constitution by +1 for an even number.
- Make Intoxicating Strike your go-to action attack to get targets Drunk.

### Level 5 — Monk 5
**Gain**
- Stunning Strike (Unarmed): Use action to possibly stun the target.
- Stunning Strike (Melee): Use action to possibly stun the target.
- Extra Attack: Make an additional free attack after making an unarmed or weapon attack.

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Default: Attack action (2 attacks) while fishing for stuns when needed.
- Bonus actions remain for extra unarmed pressure (keep your turn packed with hits).

### Level 6 — Monk 6
**Gain**
- Improved Unarmoured Movement: Your movement speed increases by 4.5m while you are not wearing armor or using a shield.
- Ki Empowered Strikes: Your unarmed attacks count as magical to overcome enemies’ Resistance and Immunity to non-magical damage.
- Leap to Your Feet: When you are Prone, standing up uses only 1.5 meters of your Movement speed.
- Redirect Attack: When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can spend 1 Ki Point as a reaction to make them attack a new target if possible.

**Play style (Level 6)**
- End turns with at least 1.5m movement left so you can stand up cheaply if knocked Prone.
- End turns with at least 1 Ki Point available so Redirect Attack is always “on.”

### Level 7 — Rogue 1
**Multiclass**
- Rogue 1

**Gain**
- Sneak Attack (Ranged & Melee): Deal an additional to an enemy you have Advantage against. Recharge: Once per turn.

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Use Rogue as the setup track for more bonus-action economy later.
- Keep doing your Monk loop; Sneak Attack is a situational add-on when advantage conditions are met.

### Level 8 — Rogue 2
**Gain**
- Cunning Action Hide: Hide from enemies by succeeding Stealth checks.
- Cunning Action Dash: Cover more distance this turn: double your Movement Speed.
- Cunning Action Disengage: Retreat safely: moving won’t provoke Opportunity Attacks.

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Use Cunning Action Dash when you need reach + still want your action for attacks.
- Use Cunning Action Disengage to safely reposition after diving a backline target.

### Level 9 — Rogue 3 (Thief)
**Subclass**
- Thief

**Gain**
- Fast Hands: Gain an additional bonus action.
- Second-Story Work: You’ve mastered the art of falling and gaining Resistance to Falling damage.

**Play style (Level 9)**
- This is the big turn-economy spike: stack your bonus actions every turn for extra unarmed pressure.
- Use the extra bonus action to stay mobile while still landing maximum hits per round.

### Level 10 — Monk 7
**Gain**
- Evasion: When a spell or effect would deal half damage on a successful Dexterity Saving Throw, it takes no damage if you succeed, and only half damage if you fail.
- Stillness of Mind: If you are Charmed or Frightened, you automatically cast Stillness of Mind to remove the condition.
- Life of the Party: Every time Intoxicating Strike hits, the monk gains Life of the Party, which increases Armour Class and Attack Rolls against Drunk targets. This effect can stack.

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Prioritize keeping targets Drunk so Life of the Party stacks and pays off defensively and offensively.
- Stay “slippery”: keep movement in reserve and maintain 1 Ki for reaction value.

### Level 11 — Monk 8
**Gain**
- Ability Improvement (feat): Increase your Dexterity to +2 which will help with damage.

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Straight power increase: higher hit chance and damage without changing your turn plan.
- Keep relying on Strength elixirs for big Tavern Brawler scaling while Dex stays your “always-on” baseline.

### Level 12 — Monk 9
**Gain**
- Martial Arts: Deft Strikes: Damage from attacks with Unarmed/Monk Weapons deal 1d8 Bludgeoning (previously 1d6) unless their normal damage is higher.
- Advanced Unarmoured Movement: Difficult Terrain doesn’t slow you down and you can Jump an additional 6 meters while you are not wearing armour or using a shield.
- Sobering Realisation: Hit a Drunk target and sober them up by dealing bonus Psychic damage. On a successful hit, the monk also loses Life of the Party.

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Use Sobering Realisation when you want burst bonus damage on a Drunk target (and can afford to drop Life of the Party).
- Difficult terrain immunity + massive mobility lets you pick targets freely—keep your rounds focused on priority enemies.
