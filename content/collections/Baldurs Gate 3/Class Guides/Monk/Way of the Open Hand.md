## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Mobility: Monks have one of the highest movement speeds for a melee build so take advantage of it offensively and defensively.
2. Bonus Actions: Make sure to use your bonus action every turn for an extra attack or utility.
3. Stuns: The Monk excels at single-target crowd control, and in later levels, you can make multiple attempts.
4. Armor: Make sure to use clothing not light, medium, or heavy armor as it’ll destroy your mobility.
5. Weapons: Stick to unarmed attacks for maximum damage.
6. Consumables: Using a potion of speed gives you a secondary action for 3 turns and is very helpful.
7. Wholeness of Body: Use this skill early during long-duration fights for 3 extra turns of bonus action.
8. Ki Points: Make sure to refresh these points after combat so you don’t run out during each encounter.
9. Opening Turn: Attempt to reach a target for attack or use bonus action for double movement speed.
10. Throw: You can throw objects when not in melee range to help keep damage high.

## Alternative Build Route
In our alternate Monk multiclass build, we suggest starting with the Way of the Open Hand and later adding Rogue to create a swift, high-damage fighter. However, this time we’re also incorporating two levels of Fighter at the end. While this setup costs you one feat, the trade-off is well worth it for gaining Action Surge, which is an incredibly valuable ability that grants you an extra action once per Short Rest. When paired with a Potion of Speed or Haste, this lets your Monk unleash a brutal second round of attacks, turning the tide of battle with a flurry of strikes.

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 brought significant updates to the Monk class in Baldur’s Gate 3, notably introducing the Way of the Drunken Master subclass.
- Abilities like “Drunken Technique” allow for swift evasions, while “Intoxicating Strike” gets targets Drunk, making the Monk a more agile and unpredictable force in combat.
- While there are no major changes to the playstyle or build for the Way of the Open Hand Monk in BG3, an alternative build incorporates some multiclassing with Fighter to unlock Action Surge, adding a bit more versatility to your Monk’s combat options.

### Patch 7
- While Patch 7 changed many aspects of BG3, the Monk build, combat, and gameplay remain relatively the same.
- On September 5th, 2024, Patch 7 for Baldur’s Gate 3 was released, bringing a massive update to the game (13 new cinematic scenes including some new battle sequences with the Netherbrain; Honour Mode enhancements with more legendary actions added to existing bosses).
- The Monk build, gear and playstyle remains the same in Patch 7. The main focus was mods, and handing the content of to creators for future gameplay.
