## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A unique martial playstyle built around **unarmed attacks for damage** and **Dexterity for offense**, with **Wisdom contributing to defense** through Unarmored Defense.
- You don’t need a weapon; your unarmed damage is **amplified with gloves**, and your turn plan revolves around **bonus actions** and **high mobility**.
- Combat focus: **movement speed**, **single target damage**, and **stuns**, with control through knockback and Prone.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Use unarmed attacks plus bonus actions to strike multiple times per turn, controlling priority targets with stuns, knockbacks, and Prone while staying highly mobile in clothing.**

### Party role
- **Striker + pressure:** multiple attacks per turn with strong scaling.
- **Single-target control:** repeat stun/prone attempts to deny enemy turns.
- **Skirmisher:** exceptional movement speed and reposition tools.

### Pros
- Single Target Stuns
- High Mobility
- Multiple Attacks Per Turn

### Cons
- Low Health
- Susceptible to Stuns
- Limited Area Damage (improves later with Ki Resonation Blast)

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: Open Hand Technique (Flurry variants: Stagger / Push / Topple)
- Level 4: Tavern Brawler + Hill Giant Strength plan
- Level 5: Extra Attack + Stunning Strike
- Level 6: Manifestations + Wholeness of Body (bonus action for 3 turns)
- Level 9: Ki Resonation Punch + Blast (adds AoE component)
- Level 12: Thief (Fast Hands) extra bonus action

---

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Wood Half-Elf
- **Class:** Monk
- **Subclass:** Way of the Open Hand
- **Background:** Urchin
- **Skills:** Acrobatics, Insight

### Ability scores (target)
- **STR:** 8
- **DEX:** 16
- **CON:** 15 (planned to reach 16 at Level 4 with Tavern Brawler’s +1)
- **INT:** 8
- **WIS:** 16
- **CHA:** 10

### Racial notes (why Wood Half-Elf)
- Recommended because they get **Civil Militia weapon proficiency**, **12-meter Darkvision**, and **the best movement speed of all races**.
- Secondary option mentioned: **Githyanki** (Misty Step, Astral Knowledge, Enhanced Leap).

### Background notes (why Urchin)
- Recommended because it gives proficiency in **Sleight of Hand** and **Stealth** (Dexterity-based), useful for dialogue and exploration.

### Starting setup notes
- **Unarmored Defense** adds Wisdom modifier to AC while not wearing armour; use **clothing** (not light/medium/heavy armour) to keep mobility.
- **Dexterous Attacks** makes Monk weapons and unarmed attacks scale with Dexterity instead of Strength if Dexterity is higher.

### Early priorities (from the guide)
- Complete Prologue; recruit companions; unlock Withers and respec companions.
- Collect the Necromancy of Thay (important in Act 3); unlock summons (Scratch, Shovel).
- Progress to level 5; reach Underdark and Grymforge; check Act 1 permanent bonuses and best gear.
