## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- A skilled and disciplined martial artist who harnesses the body’s inner energy, Ki, to perform incredible feats of physical prowess.
- A versatile subclass that allows you to harness the power of the elements, using Ki points to cast elemental spells, create elemental effects, and enhance your unarmed strikes.
- Monks who follow the Way of the Four Elements believe that the natural elements of the world are expressions of the universe’s spiritual essence, and by mastering their bodies, breath, and ki, they can channel these primordial energies and attain spiritual transcendence.

### Core Playstyle
- Fight unarmed in clothing, manage Ki carefully, and mix melee pressure with elemental Ki casting for ranged damage and crowd control when you can’t stay in melee.

### Party Role
- Melee damage dealer with swift movement and consistent unarmed pressure.
- Single-target crowd control through stuns, knockback, and prone effects.
- Versatile utility via elemental spell-like abilities powered by Ki.

### Pros
- Powerful and versatile with a mix of fisticuffs and spellcasting.
- High mobility with movement speed increases and bonus action movement options.
- Strong single-target crowd control (multiple attempts at later levels).

### Cons
- Can be difficult to master.
- You need to carefully manage your ki points and choose your elemental disciplines wisely.
- Bonus action-heavy class (optimization decisions later).

### Power Spikes
- Level 3: Way of the Four Elements subclass (Disciple of the Elements spell selections) and Harmony of Fire and Water.
- Level 4: Tavern Brawler feat (Strength modifier added twice to damage and Attack Rolls for unarmed attacks).
- Level 5: Extra Attack and Stunning Strike.
- Level 12: Thief Rogue Fast Hands (two bonus actions) enabling four attacks in one turn (two attacks with action, two bonus actions).

    - Turn 2+: Keep unarmed attacks as primary damage; use Misty Step to close distance when appropriate.
  - Notes:
    - Clench of the North Wind: Hold a humanoid enemy still; they can’t move, act, or react; attacks from within 3m are always Critical Hits.
    - “Damage on other abilities is very low in comparison to unarmed attacks.”

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Multiclass to Rogue
  - Skills: Acrobatics and Sleight of Hand
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue action attacks + bonus action attacks; use Rogue tools for positioning when needed.
    - Turn 2+: Use mobility to keep pressure and stay safe (Dash/Disengage value increases with Rogue levels).
  - Notes:
    - Suggested decision point: “The power wanes substantially” for Monk features, and “a better option to optimize the build” is taking Rogue to reach Thief for another bonus action.

    - Cunning Action Hide
    - Cunning Action Dash

- Play Style:

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Mobility: Monks have one of the highest movement speeds for a melee build so take advantage of it offensively and defensively.
2. Bonus Actions: make sure to use your bonus action every turn for an extra attack or utility.
3. Stuns: the Monk excels at single-target crowd control, and in later levels, you can make multiple attempts.
4. Armor: make sure to use clothing not light, medium, or heavy armor as it’ll destroy your mobility.
5. Spells: use spells for ranged damage and crowd control
6. Consumables: Using a potion of speed gives you a secondary action for 3 turns and is very helpful.
7. Mist Step: close the distance with Misty Step, scroll, or Githyanki bonus spell for massive movement.
8. Ki Points: make sure to refresh these points after combat so you don’t run out during each encounter.
9. Opening Turn: attempt to reach a target for attack or use bonus action for double movement speed.
10. Throw: you can throw objects when not in melee range to help keep damage high.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative Way of the Four Elements Monk Build:
  - In the alternative Solo Monk build: choose the Way of the Open Hand and later combine it with Rogue for a highly mobile, strong fighter.
  - Transition to Rogue one level earlier, allowing you to get another feat.
  - With this you can dedicate two Ability Improvements to increase your Dexterity score to 20, or swap one out for an Alert feat.
- Alternative build level progression:
  - Level 1 – Monk: Ki, Unarmored Defense, Dexterous Attacks
  - Level 2 – Monk: Unarmoured Movement, Patient Defense, Step of the Wind
  - Level 3 – Monk: Subclass: Way of the Open Hand
  - Level 4 – Monk: Feat: Tavern Brawler

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 introduced major changes to the Monk class in Baldur’s Gate 3, including balance tweaks and the addition of the Way of the Drunken Master subclass.
- The Way of the Drunken Master playstyle revolves around unpredictable movement and disorienting enemies, with abilities like “Drunken Technique” and “Tipsy Sway.”
- Overall, there are no changes to the playstyle or build for a Way of the Four Elements Monk in BG3; the build is still effective for players who enjoy the mix of fisticuffs and spellcasting.
- An alternate build is added with another option that runs along more traditional unarmed Monk lines, but is an offensive powerhouse.
