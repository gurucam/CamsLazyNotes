## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A disciplined martial artist who bends elemental energy through ki, mixing fast unarmed pressure with situational ranged control.
- Plays like a highly mobile skirmisher: you dart in, lock down or disrupt a target, then keep tempo with bonus-action follow-ups.
- Your power spikes when your action economy ramps (extra attacks + extra bonus actions later).

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Close the gap fast, pressure with repeated unarmed attacks each turn, and spend ki only when it meaningfully secures control or burst.**

### Party role
- **Mobile striker:** high movement, consistent single-target pressure.
- **Single-target control:** repeatedly attempts disables/lockdowns when needed.
- **Flex utility:** can contribute at range when melee isn’t possible.

### Pros
- Very high mobility for a melee build
- Strong single-target control options (multiple attempts later)
- Scales hard with consumables (Strength elixirs, Speed)

### Cons
- Ki is a limited resource (needs Short Rests to refresh)
- Can feel slow before key levels (subclass at 3, big spike at 5)
- Needs clothing (not armour) to keep mobility and AC plan intact

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: Subclass online (elemental disciplines)
- Level 4: Tavern Brawler + Strength plan starts to matter
- Level 5: Extra Attack + stronger control loop
- Level 10–12: Rogue dip for more bonus-action throughput (Thief)

- **Race:** Wood Half-Elf
- **Class:** Monk
- **Subclass:** Way of the Four Elements
- **Background:** Urchin
- **Skills:** Acrobatics, Insight

### Why this race (from the guide)

### Ability scores (target)
- **STR 8**

### Starting setup
- **Armor:** Clothing (not armour)
