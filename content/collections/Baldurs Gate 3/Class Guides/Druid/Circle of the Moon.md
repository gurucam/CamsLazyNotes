## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Transform into various powerful beast creatures using Wild Shape, unlocking new and more powerful forms as you level.
- A blend of spellcasting in human form and charging in like a melee fighter while using Wild Shape.
- Many Wild Shape forms have specific actions that can provide crowd control capabilities against enemies.

### Core Playstyle
- Start combat by casting a powerful spell in humanoid form, then use a bonus action to Wild Shape and fight in melee with your beast form’s actions and survivability.

### Party Role
- Support and damage character in a regular party, especially once you reach Level 6 and gain the Owlbear transformation.
- Crowd control and utility through both spells and Wild Shape form abilities (immobilization, prone, blind, etc.).
- High survivability due to Wild Shape’s separate health bar and access to healing.

### Pros
- Wild Shape provides additional survivability because each beast form comes with its own separate health bar.
- Many Wild Shape forms have specific actions that provide crowd control capabilities against enemies.
- A fun and powerful blend of spellcasting and melee (spellcasting in human form, melee pressure in Wild Shape).

### Cons
- Spell casting is unavailable while in Wild Shape.
- Wild Shape limits your ability to heal allies, which can be critical.
- You pick a subclass at level 2, so expect a slow start in terms of performance.

### Power Spikes
- Level 2: Combat Wild Shape (bonus action) and Lunar Mend; Wild Shape becomes available (2 charges per short rest).
- Level 5: Access to level 3 spells and Wild Strike (additional attack in Wild Shape).
- Level 6: New forms (Panther and Owlbear).
- Level 10: Improved Wild Strike (2 additional attacks) and Circle of the Moon Myrmidon Wild Shapes.
- Level 11: Access to level 6 spell slots (Heroes’ Feast and Heal selections).
- Level 12: Ability Improvement feat to increase Wisdom to 20; Stoneskin suggested.

    - Heroes’ Feast: cures diseases, immunizes to poison, increases hp by 2d10 for 24 hours.
    - Heal: heals 70 and removes Blindness and any diseases.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Use Bonus Actions: Use your bonus action to Wild Shape and heal yourself, and don’t let it go to waste.
2. Wild Shape: If a party member needs a heal, come out of the form and support them, then go back on the offensive.
3. Pick Right Form: Use Wild Shape to select a creature with the desired effect like the Bear when you need a tank or Deep Rothé for cc.
4. Rest: Make sure to use quick rest and long rest to replenish your spell slots before important fights.
5. Flame Shape: Drop this ability in the fray and let it soak up all the damage for you party.
6. Double Healing: Use spells like Goodberries and Healing Word to provide to heals in one turn.
7. Use Consumables: In critical situations, you can use Potion of Speed or an ally shots a Fire Arrow to turn the tide of battle.
8. Prone: Try to use ice spells to proc the prone status effect so late-game wild-shape forms can do better damage.
9. Extra Attack: Make sure to attack twice in Wild Shape form after level 5 to get the most damage out of the build.
10. Opening Turn: Use your hard-hitting damage spells as an opener and use a bonus action to go into Wild Shape.

## Alternative Build Route

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- Patch 8 brings a major update to the Druid class with the introduction of the Circle of Stars subclass, emphasizing ranged spellcasting with celestial magic, including free Guiding Bolt and a passive 1d6 attack bonus.
- The guide states Circle of Stars “performs impressively with low complexity” early when paired with Act 1 gear, but “its effectiveness fades later in the campaign,” and by Act 3 it is often outpaced by more scalable builds.
- The guide states the Circle of the Moon subclass “still remains the strongest for Druids in BG3,” remains powerful even without multiclassing, and with the right build you could “conceivably solo the game,” especially once you reach Level 6 and gain the Owlbear transformation.

### Patch 7
- Patch 7 brought “no significant combat, gameplay, or build-related change for the Circle of the Moon Druid,” and you can continue to use the build as-is.
- The guide notes Patch 7 focused on final narrative additions (mostly centered around evil endings), official modding tools, and adjustments to honor mode, including a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager.
