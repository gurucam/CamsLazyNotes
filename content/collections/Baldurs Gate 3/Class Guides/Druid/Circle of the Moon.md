## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- [cite_start]A **frontline tank and damage dealer** that uses powerful beast forms for combat[cite: 1].
- [cite_start]The build plays like a **damage-dealing machine**[cite: 1].
- [cite_start]Focuses entirely on **Wild Shape** for combat and survivability[cite: 1].

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Transform into a powerful beast form using a bonus action to tank damage and maul enemies on the frontline.**

### Party role
- [cite_start]**Frontline Tank:** Soaks up damage using the beast form's separate health pool[cite: 1].
- **Melee Damage Dealer:** Uses high-damage animal forms (Bear, Owlbear, Elemental) to overwhelm enemies.
- **Utility Caster:** Provides support and buffs outside of combat.

### Pros
- [cite_start]High survivability due to separate Wild Shape health pool[cite: 1].
- [cite_start]**Combat Wild Shape** allows for Bonus Action transformation, preserving the Action for attacks or spells[cite: 1].
- [cite_start]Early access to powerful forms (Bear, Dire Raven, Owlbear) and later to **Elemental Wild Shape**[cite: 1].

### Cons
- Heavily reliant on Wild Shape; [cite_start]**spellcasting is unavailable while transformed**[cite: 1].
- Many equipment effects are suppressed when transformed.
- Lower AC in human form compared to heavily armored characters.

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Circle of the Moon** (Bonus Action Wild Shape).
- Level 4: **Tavern Brawler Feat** (Massive boost to Wild Shape attack rolls).
- Level 5: **Extra Attack** (Two attacks in most Wild Shapes).
- Level 10: **Elemental Wild Shape** (Best tank/damage forms).

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Wood Half-Elf (Wood Elf is also a strong choice)
- **Class:** Druid
- **Subclass:** Circle of the Moon
- **Background:** Outlander or Hermit (for Survival/Medicine proficiency)
- **Skills:** Athletics, Acrobatics, Perception, Survival
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 8 / WIS 16 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Wood Half-Elf)
- **Fey Ancestry** (Advantage on saves vs. being Charmed; immunity to sleep).
- **Darkvision** (quality-of-life).
- **Shield Proficiency** (improves AC when not transformed).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** Quarterstaff or any simple weapon.
- **Armor:** Medium Armour (Druid proficiency).
- **Key Cantrip:** *Guidance* (utility), *Produce Flame* (ranged attack/light).

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Focus on getting the **Shapeshifter's Boon Ring** early.
- Prioritize high **CON** for Concentration checks on spells cast before Wild Shaping.
- Look for gear that provides **passive effects** that transfer to Wild Shape.
