## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **spell-casting damage dealer** focused on harnessing the powers of a specific natural environment or terrain type.
- Plays like "a guardian and steward of a particular region", using AoE and summons to dominate the field.
- Focuses entirely on **spells** for damage and control, not Wild Shape.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Dominate the battlefield by using potent area-of-effect spells and summoning powerful allies.**

### Party role
- **Primary Caster / Damage Dealer:** focuses on AoE spells and summons.
- **Utility Support:** provides healing and utility with non-combat spells.
- **Area Denier:** locks down large zones with control spells.

### Pros
- Access to great damage spells including AoE spells and summons.
- High maximum Spell Save DC when optimized.
- **Natural Recovery** allows for better spell slot replenishment than other Druids.

### Cons
- Heavily reliant on maintaining Concentration for control and damage spells.
- Lower durability than a Moon Druid due to less focus on Wild Shape forms.
- Limited defensive options in combat outside of medium armour.

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Level 2 Spells** (*Spike Growth*).
- Level 5: **Level 3 Spells** (*Call Lightning, Sleet Storm*).
- Level 8: **War Caster Feat** (improves Concentration).
- Level 12: **Maximized Wisdom** (highest Spell Save DC).

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Wood Half-Elf
- **Class:** Druid
- **Subclass:** Circle of the Land (Underdark, Swamp, or Arctic recommended)
- **Background:** Hermit
- **Skills:** Insight, Medicine
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 14 / CON 14 / INT 10 / WIS 17 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Wood Half-Elf)
- **Fey Ancestry** (Advantage on saves vs. being Charmed; immunity to sleep).
- **Darkvision** (quality-of-life).
- **Shield Proficiency** (improves AC).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** Quarterstaff or any simple weapon.
- **Armor:** Medium Armour (Druid proficiency).
- **Key Cantrip:** *Shillelagh* (for melee backup), *Produce Flame* (ranged attack/light).

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Focus on getting to **18 Wisdom** and obtaining **War Caster**.
- Secure gear that boosts **AC** and **Concentration**.
- Use spells like *Entangle* and *Spike Growth* to control groups of enemies early.
