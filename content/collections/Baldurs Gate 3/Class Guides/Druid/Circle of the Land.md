## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Specializes in harnessing the powers and energies of a specific natural environment or terrain type.
- Often seen as a guardian and steward of a particular region, with a strong connection to the land.
- Built as a spell-casting damage dealer with access to AoE spells and summons, focusing on area damage rather than Wild Shape form damage.

### Core Playstyle
- Play as a traditional spell caster focused on area damage and summons, using Wild Shape mainly as an extra health bar when nearly dead.

### Party Role
- Typical ranged spellcaster who plays far back around 15 meters or greater.
- Brings area-based damage and crowd control (including concentration-based options), while avoiding hitting friendlies.
- Can provide utility healing with the combination of Healing Word (bonus action) and Cure Wounds (action) for two heals in one turn.

### Pros
- Circle of the Land grants access to great damage spells including AoE spells and summons.
- Circle of the Land spells are always prepared at levels 3, 5, 7, and 9 (many otherwise unobtainable for the Druid).
- Natural Recovery helps replenish spell slots (replenish Spell Slots once per long rest / replenish expended spell slots while out of combat).

### Cons
- Druid cannot cast spells or speak in animal form.
- Equipment merges into animal form and cannot be used until reverting to humanoid form.
- Many key spells require concentration, and losing concentration due to attacks is critical to avoid.

### Power Spikes
- Level 2: Subclass selection (Circle of the Land), Natural Recovery, Wild Shape forms, and a cantrip selection.
- Level 3: Circle of the Land spells (pick one of eight Lands) and access to always prepared spells.
- Level 5: Circle of the Land spells (pick one of eight Lands) and higher-level spell options (including big area damage).
- Level 7: Circle of the Land spells (pick one of eight Lands) and access to level 4 spellcasting and summons.
- Level 9: Circle of the Land spells (pick one of eight Lands) and access to level 5 spellcasting and stronger summons.
- Level 10: Nature’s Ward and Improved Wild Strike.
- Level 11: Level 6 spell slot unlocked and Sunbeam selection.
- Level 12: Heroes’ Feast selection and +2 Wisdom (to reach 20 Wisdom per the guide).

- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Ice Knife
  - Thunderwave
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - You want to use medium armour, along with a one-handed weapon and shield.
    - Quarterstaffs are the best overall weapon early and combined with a shield you will get extra Armour Class (AC) straight away.
    - Use Ice Knife for range damage primarily and cantrips when your spell slots are exhausted.
    - Thunderwave is used for a knockback when enemies are pressuring you and can be used to get instant kill off ledges.
    - Healing Word (bonus action) and Cure Wounds (action) can be chained together in one turn for big healing.
    - Guidance is a utility cantrip and can be swapped for something else if using a Cleric in your party.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Circle of the Land
  - Natural Recovery (subclass feature): Replenish expended spell slots while out of combat.

  - Ice Knife
  - Thunderwave
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Speak with Animals
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - This build unlocks only four Wild Shape forms, but the guide does not recommend using Wild Shape beyond for an extra health bar.
    - You will only want to use Wild Shape form as an extra health bar when nearly dead, selecting the highest HP animal to transform into.

### Level 3

  - Thunderwave
  - Healing Word

  - Speak with Animals
  - Flaming Sphere
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Mirror Image ranks up your Armour Class (AC) dramatically and can single-handedly keep you alive for a few turns.
    - Misty Step is the mobility tool; the guide suggests keeping a level 2 spell slot free for retreating or getting the high ground.
    - Flaming Sphere acts as a distraction with good damage, but requires concentration (don’t use it with another concentration-based spell).

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Poison Spray (cantrip)
  - Heat Metal (spell selection)
  - Ability Improvement (feat selection): Add +2 Wisdom
  - Wild Shape Deep Rothé
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Ice Knife
  - Thunderwave
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Speak with Animals
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Heat Metal
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Heat Metal is described as an especially amazing crowd control on weapon-based damage dealers (example given: Githyanki Fighters), forcing them to let go or receive Disadvantage on Attack Rolls and Ability Checks.
    - Heat Metal costs concentration.
    - The guide notes other feat options (Spell Sniper, Warlock Initiate, Lucky), but recommends Ability Improvement here and War Caster later due to concentration-based spells.

  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Speak with Animals
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Heat Metal

    - Grant Flight is useful during environmental hazard-heavy fights or non-combat questing.
    - Call Lightning and Sleet Storm are big area damage but require concentration; Call Lightning can be cast repeatedly without using a spell slot after the initial cast.

  - Flaming Sphere
  - Heat Metal

    - Owlbear gives a big burst of health and can save your life at this level versus a potion.
    - Around level 6 you should be close to transitioning out of Act 1; the guide notes to check traders, stock up on camp and alchemy supplies, and consider collecting Grymforge (Adamantine) crafting items before transitioning to Act 2 (Moonrise Tower), where you won’t be able to return.

  - Notes:
    - The guide states you will instantly unlock three level 4 spells but will only be able to use one via lack of spell slots.
    - The guide calls Minor Elemental (using the two Ice Mephits) the best choice at this point: great range damage dealers and provide support and crowd control without concentration.
    - Ice Storm is a massive area-based damage spell to be used later once more spell slots are unlocked.
    - The guide wants to unlock Conjure Woodland Being to cast in conjunction with Minor Elemental at level 8, using two spell slots to have three creatures supporting the team until the next Long Rest.

    - Daylight is described as a utility spell in case an enemy casts Darkness.
    - War Caster is taken due to the number of spells requiring concentration (Spell Sniper, Warlock Initiate, Lucky are also noted as choices if concentration isn’t an issue).

    - The guide says Contagion is an okay spell, but wants to use the spell slot for Conjure Elemental.
    - The guide prefers Earth Elemental (over 120 health and crowd control capabilities).
    - Remember to cast summons after every Long Rest as they will follow you around without disappearing.

### Level 10
- Gain:
