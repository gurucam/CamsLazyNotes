## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Offensive Druid that uses Wild Shape charges for damage rather than shapeshifting.
- Fungal/necrotic theme: spores, undead, and necrotic damage.
- Summons creatures (undead or otherwise) to help aid in combat.

### Core Playstyle
- Play offensively at range like a traditional spell caster, using Wild Shape charges to power a long-rest damage buff and repeatedly adding “free” reaction damage while stacking multiple summons.

### Party Role
- Area damage spellcaster.
- Summoner (can reach a total of five extra fighters for the party).
- Ranged damage dealer who benefits from up-front melee pressure and support healing.

### Pros
- Summon 5x Creatures
- Great Area Damage
- Free Reaction Abilities

### Cons
- Doesn’t Shape Shift
- Lower Mobility
- Weak Healing

### Power Spikes
- Level 2: Circle of the Spores (Halo of Spores, Symbiotic Entity, Bone Chill) + Wild Shape charges used for damage.
- Level 5: Level 3 spell slots + Animate Dead (until-long rest summon).
- Level 6: Fungal Infestation (reaction-based zombie that stacks with other summons).
- Level 7: Conjure Woodland Beings + level 4 options and stronger offensive spells.
- Level 9: Conjure Elemental (another long-rest summon) + Cloudkill/Contagion always-prepared.
- Level 10: Spreading Spores (bonus action damage-over-time that doesn’t damage allies).
- Level 11: Level 6 slot + Heroes’ Feast (long-rest buff).
- Level 12: Final feat (+2 Wisdom to 20) + Wind Walk + Planar Binding.

    - Healing Word (spell)
    - Cure Wounds (spell)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Ice Knife
  - Thunderwave
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Use Ice Knife for range damage primarily and Fire Bolt when your spell slots are exhausted.
    - Thunderwave is used for a knockback when enemies are pressuring you.
    - Guidance is a utility cantrip and can be swapped for something else if using a Cleric in your party.
    - Picking up two heals (Cure Wounds and Healing Word) allows you to chain them together in one turn for big healing.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Circle of the Spores
  - Wild Shape (class feature): As an action, you can assume the form of a beast. You can transform twice per short rest.
  - Halo of Spores (subclass feature): Unleash a cloud of Necrotic spores upon a target dealing 1d4 Necrotic damage used as reaction.
  - Symbiotic Entity (subclass feature): Gain 8 temporary hit points per Druid level and deal an additional 1-6d damage necrotic Damage while you have them. Cast Halo of Spores with double damage. Consumes a Wild Shape Charge.
  - Bone Chill cantrip (subclass feature): deal 1-8 necrotic damage and prevent the target from healing until your next turn. Undead get Disadvantage on Attack Rolls.

  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Ice Knife (action) + Healing Word (bonus action) + Halo of Spores (reaction) (example given).
  - Notes:
    - Symbiotic Entity lasts until the next long rest; always recast this after resting in camp.
    - With this setup, use Wild Shape not to transform but to feed Symbiotic Entity (exception: extra health from stronger beasts if you are about to die).
    - Halo of Spores is “free” because it uses a reaction; focus on positioning to stay close enough (6m) to keep casting it.
    - Aim for 15 to 16 AC or higher; focus on survivability first (one hand + shield can help early).

### Level 3
- Gain:

- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Ice Knife

- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Blindness and Detect Thoughts are always prepared (still consume a spell slot but do not take up spots in your spellbook).
    - Use Flaming Sphere for distraction damage early in the game and as a concentration spell.
    - Continue using Halo of Spores and cantrips for free damage, and use spell slots for healing and utility with Ice Knife being range damage dealing.

  - Heat Metal (spell selection)
  - Ability Improvement (feat): Put an additional +2 points into Wisdom
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Ice Knife
  - Thunderwave

  - Cure Wounds
  - Animal Speaking
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Heat Metal
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Heat Metal can be used as a hard counter to weapon-based users like the Githyanki, but cannot be used in conjunction with Flaming Sphere (choose one or the other).
    - The guide notes: “We don’t have mega concentration spells so choosing the War Caster feat is out atm.”
    - Another good feat mentioned: “Warlock Initiative for access to Hellish Rebuke and Eldritch Blast.”

### Level 5

    - You can stack Flaming Sphere summon with Animate Dead giving you two allies on the battlefield.
    - Animate Dead is until-long rest at the expense of a spell slot; typically summon from a corpse from a previous fight before entering combat.
    - Summons stack (they do not unsummon one another) and help with free damage and distractions.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Fungal Infestation (subclass feature): Raises a mildewed, mould-encrusted zombie from a corpse until long rest (beast or humanoid corpse). Reaction-based.

  - Ice Knife
  - Thunderwave
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Animal Speaking
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Heat Metal
  - Call Lighting
  - Sleet Storm
  - Gust of Wind
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Fungal Infestation stacks with your other summons and lasts until a long rest.
    - Typically use Animate Dead and Fungal Infestation out of combat at the scene of a corpse-heavy previous fight to collect two summons until long rest.
    - If a player drops, you can use this reaction (instead of Halo of Spores) to get an additional ally on the battlefield.
    - Gust of Wind is selected as a utility spell and the guide notes it will be dropped next level for level 4 spells.

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Level 4 spells unlocked (pick selections as described)

  - Notes:
    - Drop Gust of Wind and pick up both Ice Storm (requires no concentration) and Conjure Woodland Being.
    - Conjure Woodland Beings stacks with your other summons (the guide states you can have four other creatures fighting for you aside from your main party members).
    - Blight is a powerful offensive burst damage spell; Ice Storm is area-based damage at range.
    - Confusion is great for massive fights with up to 6 targets and can cause enemies to attack each other.

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Wall of Fire (spell selection)
  - War Caster (feat selection)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Ice Knife
  - Thunderwave
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Animal Speaking
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Heat Metal
  - Call Lighting
  - Sleet Storm
  - Ice Storm
  - Conjure Woodland Being
  - Wall of Fire
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - War Caster is taken because most big nukes are concentration-based at this stage, and the guide plans to still reach 20 Wisdom with another feat at level 12.
    - Wall of Fire is “seldom used in comparison to Blight or Ice Storm” but can be helpful in choke points.
    - War Caster helps you maintain concentration and thus keep damage or crowd control spells active.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Conjure Elemental (spell selection)
  - Cloudkill (subclass feature): Always prepared
  - Contagion (subclass feature): Always prepared
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):

  - Cure Wounds
  - Animal Speaking
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Heat Metal
  - Call Lighting
  - Sleet Storm
  - Ice Storm
  - Conjure Woodland Being
  - Wall of Fire
  - Conjure Elemental
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Another summon becomes available and stacks with the others; the guide states “A total of five extra fighters for our party!”
    - The guide prefers the Earth Elemental because of its health and ability to stun enemies.
    - Conjure Elemental is another long rest ability; expect to buff with “4 or so spells” after every long rest to avoid losing actions if combat starts unexpectedly.

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Improved Wild Strike (class feature): You can make 2 additional attacks after making an unarmed strike while in Wild Shape.
  - Mass Cure Wounds (spell selection)
  - Spreading Spores (subclass feature)

  - Call Lighting
  - Sleet Storm
  - Ice Storm
  - Conjure Woodland Being
  - Wall of Fire
  - Conjure Elemental
  - Mass Cure Wound
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Spreading Spores is a bonus action and stacks on top of the reaction spell Halo of Spores, and Fungal Infestation.
    - The guide states you can use “one action, one bonus action, and two reactions offensively per turn if conditions are met.”
    - Spreading Spores doesn’t damage allies in the area and has a 9m radius; use it if you have a bonus action to spare to keep up damage over time.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Heroes’ Feast (spell selection)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Ice Knife
  - Thunderwave
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Animal Speaking
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Heat Metal
  - Call Lighting
  - Sleet Storm
  - Ice Storm
  - Conjure Woodland Being
  - Wall of Fire
  - Conjure Elemental
  - Mass Cure Wound
  - Heroes’ Feast
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Take Heroes’ Feast as a long rest buff: you and everyone around can’t be Poisoned, Diseased, or Frightened; everyone’s maximum hit points increase by 12; Wisdom saving throws with Advantage.
    - The guide recommends using this level 6 spell slot always following a Long Rest.
    - The guide notes you can bypass having only one level 6 slot using Staff of Spellpower or Markoheshkir (can cast a spell without consuming a spell slot), enabling a burst damage ability and a long rest buff combination.

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Wind Walk (spell selection)
  - Planar Binding (extra spell)
  - Ability Improvement (feat selection): Add a +2 to Wisdom for max of 20
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Ice Knife
  - Thunderwave
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Animal Speaking
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Heat Metal
  - Call Lighting
  - Sleet Storm
  - Ice Storm
  - Conjure Woodland Being
  - Wall of Fire
  - Conjure Elemental
  - Mass Cure Wound
  - Heroes’ Feast
  - Wind Walk
  - Planar Binding
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Wind Walk is described as similar to Gaseous Form: a utility spell that can temporarily shield you from attacks and can help getting into small spaces.
    - The guide says: “Take the Sunbeam spell instead if you get the two powerful Quarterstaff mentioned at level 11.”
    - The final Ability Improvement feat gets Wisdom to 20, meaning damage spells will be hitting for their maximum amount of damage (as stated).

### Wild Shape Explained (as described)
- Available once the Druid reaches level 2, with two charges replenished on each short rest.
- When a druid Wild Shapes, they take on the game statistics of their beast form (hit points, armor class, movement speed, Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution).
- They also gain special abilities of the beast form (climb walls, fly, breathe underwater).
- A Druid cannot cast spells or speak in animal form.
- Equipment merges into animal form and cannot be used until reverting to humanoid form.
- For this Circle of Spores build: casting Symbiotic Entity requires a Wild Shape charge; the build uses Wild Shape charges for damage rather than shapeshifting.

- Cantrips: like spells, but you can cast them infinitely, and they don’t require spell slots.
- Spell Slots: limited resources for casting spells, replenished on long rest.
- Spell Levels: potency and level of the spell; in BG3 up to level 6.
- Prepared Spells: allow you to swap in and out spells in between combat.
- Concentration: requires you to maintain concentration otherwise the spell effect ends.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Early gameplay and gear priorities (as described):
  - Equip anything at the start; within a few levels, switch to medium armour, quarterstaff, and a shield after selecting your subclass.
  - It’s not until later in Act 3 you find and equip powerful Light Armour sets.
  - Look to stockpile and collect Elixir of Bloodlust and Potion of Speed (these can “stack” potentially giving you 3 actions in one turn).
  - Later in Acts 2 and 3, you can stack Elixir of Battlemage’s Power and others for even more powerful spells.
- Ending Act 1 (as described):
  - Around Level 6, stock up on camp and alchemy supplies, ensure you haven’t missed best Act 1 items and permanent bonuses.
  - Grymforge has powerful armor and weapons (Adamantine) that can aid into Act 3; craft some before transitioning to Act 2 (where you won’t be able to return to this map).
- 10 gameplay, combat tips, and tricks (as listed):
  1. Wild Shape: save these charges for Spores vs Transforming.
  2. Summons: Constantly use your summons and attack with them.
  3. Range: Try to stay close enough for 6m Halo of Spores but far enough away to avoid melee damage.
  4. Rest: Make sure to use quick rest and long rest to replenish your spell slots before important fights.
  5. Flame Shape: Drop this ability in the fray and let it soak up all the damage for your party.
  6. Double Healing: Use spells like Healing Word and Cure Wound for two heals one one turn.
  7. Use Consumables: In critical situations, you can use Potion of Speed for two actions per turn.
  8. Prone: Try to use ice spells to proc the prone status effect so late-game wild-shape forms can do better damage.
  9. Reactions: Make sure to use your reaction-based spells every turn for extra damage.
  10. Opening Turn: Use your hard-hitting damage spells as an opener and keep one concentration spell only active.

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- The build page is updated for Patch 8.
- Most notable Druid class change: addition of the Circle of Stars subclass.
- Circle of Stars: grants access to Guiding Bolt and a subclass feature that boosts attack rolls by 1d6, shifting playstyle toward a ranged spellcaster.
- Circle of Stars pairs effectively with early-game armor and jewelry found in Act 1; strength tapers off in later acts, particularly Act 3.
- Circle of Stars is “not inherently more powerful” than other subclasses; Circle of the Spores is still a strong option.
- The guide mentions: if interested in multiclassing and possibly picking up the Booming Blade cantrip via Wizard, there is an alternative recommendation (see Alternative Build Route).

### Patch 7
- Patch 7 brought “no significant combat, gameplay, or build-related changes” for Circle of the Spores.
- Main focus: final narrative additions centered around evil endings, official modding tools, and adjustments to honour mode.
- Release date stated: September 5, 2024; added 13 new cinematic scenes including new battle sequences with the Netherbrain, and Honour Mode enhancements with more legendary actions added to existing bosses.
