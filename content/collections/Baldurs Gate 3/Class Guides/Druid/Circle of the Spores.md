## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **Necromancer/Summoner hybrid** who uses infectious spores and temporary hit points to fight on the frontline.
- Plays like a "dark Druid" who manipulates life and death, turning fallen enemies into allies.
- Focuses on **Symbiotic Entity** for offense and using the resulting temporary HP for defense.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Engage Symbiotic Entity to gain temporary HP and bonus necrotic damage, then command a growing army of summons and undead allies.**

### Party role
- **Frontline Damage/Tank:** Uses Symbiotic Entity for offensive boost and durability.
- **Summoner/Necromancer:** Raises allies from the dead and controls multiple summons.
- **AoE Controller:** Uses the Aura of Spores for persistent area damage.

### Pros
- **Symbiotic Entity** provides great damage and survivability early on.
- Excellent at summoning, with access to both traditional and undead allies.
- Melee attacks benefit from a Necrotic damage boost, unlike other Druid subclasses.

### Cons
- Temporary HP from Symbiotic Entity is key; losing it drops both offense and defense significantly.
- Needs to manage Wild Shape charges carefully, as they fuel Symbiotic Entity.
- Relies on maintaining Concentration for summons and control spells.

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Symbiotic Entity** and **Fungal Infestation** (Core subclass mechanics).
- Level 4: **Tavern Brawler Feat** (If focusing on Shillelagh melee attacks).
- Level 5: **Level 3 Spells** (Best summoning spells unlocked).
- Level 10: **Spreading Spores** (Better AoE necrotic damage).

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Wood Half-Elf
- **Class:** Druid
- **Subclass:** Circle of the Spores
- **Background:** Outlander
- **Skills:** Perception, Survival
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 8 / WIS 17 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Wood Half-Elf)
- **Fey Ancestry** (Advantage on saves vs. being Charmed; immunity to sleep).
- **Darkvision** (quality-of-life).
- **Shield Proficiency** (improves AC).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** Quarterstaff or any simple weapon.
- **Armor:** Medium Armour (Druid proficiency).
- **Key Cantrip:** *Shillelagh* (for main hand weapon damage), *Guidance* (utility).

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Acquire gear that boosts **AC** and **Concentration**.
- Use **Symbiotic Entity** immediately at the start of combat.
- Find the **Shapeshifter's Boon Ring** to help Symbiotic Entity resist saving throws.
