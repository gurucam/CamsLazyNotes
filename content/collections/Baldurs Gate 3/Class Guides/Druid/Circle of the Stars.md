## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- A powerful and versatile Druid that doesn’t use Wild Shape forms.
- Leans heavily into ranged spellcasting, blending celestial magic with consistent offensive output.
- Plays more like an archer with spells, taking advantage of Act 1 armor and jewelry to increase overall power.

### Core Playstyle
- Use a Starry Archer form to spend your Bonus Action on a luminous arrow and your Action on ranged damage, pairing Radiant damage gear to trigger additional effects.

### Party Role
- Ranged Radiant damage dealer, especially effective in the early game.
- Damage and healing toolkit through Starry Form options.
- Gains AoE Radiant spells later via multiclassing.

### Pros
- Fast Start
- Ranged Radiant Damage
- Damage and Healing

### Cons
- Weaker in Act 3
- Multiclassing Needed
- Lacks AoE early on

### Power Spikes
- Act 1: Using Luminous Armour and Guiding Bolt for damage.
- Level 6: “your power dramatically increases.”
- Later levels: Spiritual Guardians in combination with Radiant Damage will add massive AoE damage.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks

  - “Pair Luminous Armour and Luminous Gloves together to create a Radiant Shockwave, dealing extra damage.”
  - “Make sure to cast Light on yourself to take advantage of Coruscation Ring and Callous Glow ring combo which inflicts Radiant Orb to well-lit targets hit with Radiant Damage.”
- General Tips:
  - Loot Everything: “You will need a lot of gold to buy consumables, potions, and ammunition so loot and sell constantly.”
  - Crafting: “Elixirs and potions are vital, and you need to purchase materials when trading for crafting.”
  - Reach Level 6: “Spend the early part of the game completing every quest to reach level 6 where your power dramatically increases.”
  - Sell Often: “Your carrying capacity will be limited so sell often, and store excessive items in your traveler’s chest.”
  - Stealth: “Start combat in stealth if at all possible to trigger the Surprise status effect.”

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- “Patch 8 introduces a game-changing addition to the Druid class in Baldur’s Gate 3 with the arrival of the Circle of Stars subclass.”
- “Core features like free access to Guiding Bolt and a passive bonus that adds 1d6 to attack rolls give it the feel of a magical marksman, particularly effective in the early game.”
- “That said, its impact diminishes as the campaign progresses, and by Act 3, the build’s early-game strengths can feel outpaced by more scalable options.”
- “Therefore, the Circle of the Stars Druid build below will recommend that you multiclass into Cleric in later levels.”
- “Patch 8 of BG3 releases 12 new subclasses with one being the Circle of the Stars Druid.”
- “The major change for the Druid class is Tavern Brawler now works within wild shape form.”
