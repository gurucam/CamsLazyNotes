## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **ranged spellcaster** who channels the power of constellations to deal high radiant damage or provide powerful healing.
- Plays like a versatile support or damage dealer, using a flexible celestial form.
- Focuses entirely on **Spellcasting** and the **Starry Form** feature.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Use your Starry Form as a Bonus Action to gain versatile combat effects, specializing in ranged radiant damage and potent support spells.**

### Party role
- **Primary Caster / Ranged Damage:** Uses Starry Form: Archer for consistent ranged damage.
- **Support / Healer:** Uses Starry Form: Chalice for powerful Bonus Action healing.
- **Utility Support:** Provides buffs and control with standard Druid spells.

### Pros
- Starry Forms are highly flexible for offense, defense, and healing.
- **Starry Form: Archer** provides reliable ranged radiant damage without consuming spell slots.
- Excellent utility and survivability due to free forms and bonus action mechanics.

### Cons
- Heavily reliant on **Bonus Action** economy (Starry Form, Healing, Archer Attacks).
- Archer form damage scales slowly after early game.
- Lower durability than a Moon Druid due to less focus on Wild Shape forms.

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Starry Form** (Archer form unlocked).
- Level 5: **Level 3 Spells** (Call Lightning, Sleet Storm) & **Extra Radiant Damage**.
- Level 8: **War Caster Feat** (improves Concentration).
- Level 10: **Twinkling Constellation** (Switch forms as a Bonus Action).
