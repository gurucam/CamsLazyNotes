## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Hard-hitting tank that focuses on dealing damage and being durable in combat.
- Two-handed weapon style with an ultra-aggressive playstyle to deal massive damage.
- Champion emphasizes critical strikes and burst damage with Improved Critical (19–20 crit range).

### Core Playstyle
- Charge into melee with a Greatsword, use Extra Attack + Action Surge for multiple attacks, and lean into critical strikes (and advantage) to fuel Great Weapon Master bonus-action attacks.

### Party Role
- Front-line damage dealer with burst potential.
- Durable melee presence with high hit points and heavy armor.
- Creates pressure by getting into melee range while companions provide support, ranged damage, or crowd control.

### Pros
- Very durable: high hit points and access to all armor and weapon types.
- Action economy powerhouse (Extra Attack, Action Surge, and later Improved Extra Attack).
- Improved Critical supports a critical strike build and burst damage.

### Cons
- Lacks spellcasting or superiority dice utility compared to other Fighter subclasses.
- Can feel weak early until level 5 when you gain Extra Attack.
- Initiative is a weakness because you don’t stack much Dexterity due to heavy armor and Strength-based damage.

### Power Spikes
- Level 2: Action Surge (one additional action).
- Level 3: Champion subclass (Improved Critical Hit; reduced crit roll requirement).
- Level 4: Great Weapon Master (bonus action attack on crit/kill; high risk/high reward -5 attack roll for +10 damage).
- Level 5: Extra Attack (two attacks on Attack action).
- Level 8: Alert (+5 Initiative and can’t be Surprised).
- Level 11: Improved Extra Attack (two additional attacks after attacking with main-hand weapon).

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Great Weapon Fighting
  - Second Wind
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - “Don’t expect much gameplay-wise outside of attacking with a melee weapon.”
    - “Aim to pick up a Greatsword right away.”
    - “Use the medium armor you have until you find better heavy armor and get a crossbow.”
    - Prologue note: ideally obtain the Everburn Blade and give it to Lae’zel.
    - Second Wind is a bonus action self-heal, so you can heal and attack in one turn.
    - Great Weapon Fighting rerolls damage die results of 1 or 2 once for two-handed melee attacks.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Action Surge
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Action Surge: gain one additional action (replenished on Short Rest).
    - “Play aggressively and charge in.”
    - “Don’t forget to equip a bow because you want some type of range weapon when melee isn’t an option because of distance.”

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Champion
  - Improved Critical Hit
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Improved Critical Hit reduces the number needed to roll a Critical Hit by 1 and this effect can stack.
    - You can reduce the critical hit dice roll further with feat and gear (stacking).
    - Using Champion means you lack spellcasting or superiority dice; rely on weapon skills or companion spells for stuns, buffs, and crowd control.
    - “Your goal is to reach enemies and do damage with an advantage at every turn.”
    - Advantage mechanic rolls two D20 and selects the higher of the two.
    - Stockpile weapon poisons and elemental arrows (example uses: ice to proc prone; put an enemy asleep if you need a stun).

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Feat: Great Weapon Master
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Great Weapon Master:
      - When a melee attack scores a critical hit or kills a creature, you can make another melee attack as a bonus action.
      - When attacking with Heavy Weapons you are proficient with, attack rolls take a -5 penalty, but their damage increases by 10.
    - You can toggle the -5/+10 effect off in Passives for more consistent hit chance early.
    - “Combat should therefore be initiated using your action first, saving your bonus action for a Great Weapons Master attack.”

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Extra Attack
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Extra Attack allows two attacks when you take the Attack action.
    - Example burst sequence described:
      - Two attacks (Extra Attack)
      - Bonus action attack via Great Weapon Master (on kill or crit)
      - Action Surge for another two attacks (total 5)
      - Can be 7 with Potion of Speed or Haste (another action once per turn).

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Strength; total 18)
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - +2 Strength helps hit harder and land attacks (especially with Great Weapon Master).
    - If you previously toggled Great Weapon Master off due to low hit chance, turn it back on as Strength increases.
    - “Use the spell Bless or have someone cast it on you for much higher percentages and big damage!”
    - “Gameplay remains unchanged, get aggressive and try to land critical strikes with advantage dice rolls.”

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Remarkable Athlete: Proficiency
  - Remarkable Athlete: Jump
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - In combat, “the only benefit is the jump distance.”
    - Remarkable Athlete (Proficiency): add half Proficiency Bonus to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution Checks you are not Proficient in.
    - Remarkable Athlete (Jump): Jump distance increased by 3m.
    - “Combat remains the same.”

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Feat: Alert
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Alert: +5 Initiative and can’t be Surprised.
    - Initiative is described as a Fighter weakness (low Dexterity due to heavy armor and Strength-based damage).
    - Alert helps you open fights earlier to crowd control or kill multiple targets, reducing incoming damage.
    - Surprised condition can skip a round; this matters in dialogue-based combat starts in Acts 2 and 3.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Indomitable
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Indomitable: when you fail a Saving Throw, you can roll again using the new result instead.
    - Described as a simple passive survivability feature that requires zero actions.

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Additional Fighting Style: Defence
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Defence increases Armour Class (AC) by +1 while wearing armor.
    - Can swap to Archery if you find yourself using range (not expected).
    - “Combat remains unchanged, just slightly more durable.”

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Improved Extra Attack
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Improved Extra Attack: “You can make two additional attacks after attacking with your main-hand weapon.”
    - Described as making Fighter the most action-heavy class/build (multiple actions, plus Action Surge, plus Great Weapon Master bonus action attack, plus Potion of Speed / Haste options).
    - Alert is described as especially powerful here if the Fighter goes early and avoids being crowd controlled.

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Strength; total 20)
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - “Improving our Strength to 20 is the play with this feat.”

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks

- Bonus Action: Make use of your bonus action with skills like Pommel or even shove to knock back enemies.
- Potion of Speed: Use these potions to gain movement and more actions in challenging fights.
- Rest: Make sure to rest when your superiority dies are low so you start with many available.
- Equip Range: Find and equip a bow early because it will increase your kill potential and take advantage of Fighters weapon versatility.
- Make use of Action Surge: Save Action Surge for critical moments in combat or to gain an advantage over tough opponents.
- Action and Bonus Actions: Try to make use of both your action and bonus action every turn, especially with Great Weapon Master.
- Maximize your Attacks: Consider using Action Surge for an additional set of attacks with Extra Attack after level 5.
- Weapon Selection: Use a Greatsword due to their secondary ability and bonuses in BG3.
- Utilize Maneuvers: Maneuvers are great for crowd control and should be used early in combat.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative Champion Fighter Build – Spellcaster Playstyle:
  - “For Fighter builds that want more spellcasting and damage potential, you should take 1 level of the Warlock and select the Hexblade subclass at Level 12.”
  - Described benefits: extra bonus action utility, two good spells, and a powerful range cantrip; adds utility for solo play while sacrificing one feat.
  - Notes included:
    - “Your feats should be enough to reach 20 Strength and Great Weapon Master.”
    - “Additionally, you can take 17 in character creation if you plan to get Auntie Ethel’s bonus in Act 1.”
- Alternative leveling table shown in the guide (as written):
  - Level 1: Fighter — Great Weapon Fighting
  - Level 2: Fighter — –
  - Level 3: Fighter — Subclass: Eldritch Knight, Booming Blade, Friends, Shield, Thunderwave, Longstrider

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- The guide states: “This build page has been updated for the Patch 8 version of Baldur’s Gate 3.”
- The most obvious change influencing builds in Patch 8 is the addition of 12 new subclasses and their abilities and synergies.
- Specifically called out: Eldritch Knight becomes much stronger with the addition of Booming Blade Cantrip, allowing extra thunder damage each action.
- Guidance included:
  - “If you’re looking for a hard-hitting tank playstyle then the previous build is still very effective.”
  - “However, consider the Eldritch Knight if you want extra spellcasting utility.”
  - Notes about multiclass options mentioned: 11 levels of Fighter and 1 Warlock for more spellcasting potential; 1 level of Hexblade Warlock adds utility with the downside of losing one feat.
