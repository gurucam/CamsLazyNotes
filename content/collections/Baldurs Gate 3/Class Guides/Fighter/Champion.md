## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- The Fighter class is a great choice for players who want to focus on dealing damage and being a hard-hitting tank in Baldur’s Gate 3.
- Fighters have a high hit point pool and access to a variety of armor and weapons, making them very durable in combat.
- They also have a few abilities that can help them deal more damage, such as Action Surge and Second Wind.
- This build is focused on using a two-handed weapon style and an ultra-aggressive playstyle to deal massive damage.
- The Champion subclass prioritizes burst damage, and we will aim for dealing maximum damage with a feat that feeds into a critical strike build.
- With their high damage output and survivability, Fighters are an asset to any party.
- If you’re looking for a build that can dish out a lot of punishment and take a lot of hits in BG3 Patch 8, then the Fighter Champion is a great choice for you.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Close distance fast, swing a two-hander as many times as possible each turn, and stack extra actions/attacks to burst down priority targets before they can act.**

### Party role
- **Frontline bruiser/tank:** high AC + high HP + heavy armour lets you stand in melee.
- **Burst damage dealer:** critical strike focus + bonus-action follow-up pressure.
- **Action economy carry:** extra actions convert directly into multiple heavy weapon hits.

### Pros
- Ultra simple to play and very effective
- High durability: high HP pool + all armour proficiencies
- Strong burst turns through extra actions and extra attacks
- Champion critical bonus is straightforward and stacks well with crit gear

### Cons
- Limited built-in crowd control compared to other Fighter subclasses
- Relies heavily on weapon actions, consumables, terrain, and companions for utility
- Can feel weak early until level 5 (Extra Attack)

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Action Surge** (extra action)
- Level 3: **Champion — Improved Critical** (crits on 19–20)
- Level 4: **Great Weapon Master** (kill/crit → bonus-action attack; optional -5/+10 toggle)
- Level 5: **Extra Attack**
- Level 8: **Alert** (+5 initiative; can’t be Surprised)
- Level 11: **Improved Extra Attack** (3 attacks per action)

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Half-Orc
- **Class:** Fighter
- **Subclass:** Champion
- **Background:** Soldier
- **Skills:** Acrobatics and Athletics
- **Abilities (target):** STR 16 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 8 / WIS 10 / CHA 10

### Recommended backgrounds (from the guide)
- Soldier: Proficiency in Athletics (strength) and Intimidation (Wisdom). You are trained in battlefield tactics and combat, having served in a militia, mercenary company, or officer corps.
- Outlander: Proficiency in Athletics (strength) and Survival (Wisdom). You grew up in the wilds, learning to survive far from the comforts of civilization.
- Urchin: Proficiency in Sleight of Hand (dexterity) and Stealth (dexterity). After surviving a poor and bleak childhood, you know how to make the most out of very little.

### Best race choice notes (from the guide)
- For a Champion Fighter build in Baldur’s Gate 3, the Half-Orc and Duergar Dwarf races stand out as the best choices.
- The Half-Orc’s innate abilities include enhanced critical damage, resilience, and intimidation.
- The Duergar Dwarf boasts the Enlarge Spell and Invisibility, aiding in damage and improving defensive capabilities.
- The Fighter’s racial choice will not influence ability score, as everyone should get a +2 and +1 to spend regardless.

### Recommended skills (from the guide)
- Acrobatics: Dexterity skill that helps resist being shoved.
- Perception: Wisdom skill that spots hidden containers, mechanisms, traps, and creatures.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- At the start of the game, you will feel weak until level 5 where you gain Extra Attack.
- Your priority for a Fighter build is locating heavy armour, a two-handed Greatsword, and a Longbow or Heavy Crossbow.
- Lae’zel, who you meet in the prologue has powerful medium armour with 15 AC along with a Heavy Crossbow. If you don’t plan on using this companion, take her gear immediately and equip her for a big boost in overall survivability and ranged damage.
- From this point, you need to hoard potions, arrows, and consumable potions.
- Look to acquire Elixir of Hill Giant Strength, Potion of Speed, and Oil of Accuracy consumables. These three consumables “stack” allowing for massive damage.
- Your overall priority with this build is the following:
  - Complete Prologue
  - Recruit Companions
  - Unlock Withers, respec companions to proper class/ability score
  - Collect the Necromancy of Thay (important in Act 3)
  - Reach Druid Grove
  - Sell, Stock up, complete quests
  - Unlock summons, Scratch, Shovel
  - Progress to level 5
  - Reach Underdark and Grymforge
  - Check all Permanent Bonuses in Act 1 and the best Gear
  - Act 1 Checklist for step-by-step completion

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
### Alternative Champion Fighter Build – Spellcaster Playstyle
- For Fighter builds that want more spellcasting and damage potential, you should take 1 level of the Warlock and select the Hexblade subclass at Level 12.
- The Warlock Hexblade gives you extra bonus action utility, two good spells, and a powerful range cantrip.
- Even though it’s a Charisma class, the Warlock one level dip adds a lot of utility for the Fighter at the expense of a feat.
- Moreover, your feats should be enough to reach 20 Strength and Great Weapon Master.
- Additionally, you can take 17 in character creation if you plan to get Auntie Ethel’s bonus in Act 1.
- This combination gives you great range, melee damage, and utility playing the Fighter class.
