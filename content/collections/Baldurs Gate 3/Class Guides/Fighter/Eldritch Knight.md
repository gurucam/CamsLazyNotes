## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- The Eldritch Knight subclass grants the pure physical melee Fighter class the ability to cast spells.
- This hybrid playstyle provides new defensive and self-healing spells and cantrips.
- The downside is the Eldritch Knight will sacrifice some damage potential and your pool of spell slots is not very deep.
- To avoid crippling the raw strength of the Fighter too much, consider Intelligence a secondary priority.
- You want to use your spells to increase your Armour Class (AC) or provide a little self-healing.
- Fighters have a high hit point pool and access to a variety of armor and weapons, making them very durable in combat.
- At max level, the Eldritch Knight should be obnoxious to kill: very high AC, frequent melee attacks, and lots of utility to help crowd control or survive.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Play like a durable frontline fighter: get into melee range, keep your attack action focused on weapon swings, and use your limited magic as “defensive utility” to stay alive while you grind enemies down.**

### Party role
- **Frontline tank / bruiser:** heavy armour + shield + very high AC.
- **Durable melee DPS:** weapon attacks remain your main output.
- **Utility support:** extra tools for survivability, control, and out-of-combat interactions.

### Pros
- High damage
- Good survivability
- Allows some spellcasting

### Cons
- Less DPS than Battle Master
- Not good for dialogue Ability Checks
- Low on spell slots

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: Action Surge (extra action)
- Level 3: Eldritch Knight (spellcasting + weapon bond)
- Level 5: Extra Attack (two attacks per Attack action)
- Level 7: War Magic (cantrip into bonus-action weapon attack)
- Level 8: Shield Master (survivability spike)
- Level 11: Improved Extra Attack (3 attacks per action)
- Level 12: Tough (big HP increase)

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Zariel Tiefling
- **Class:** Fighter
- **Subclass:** Eldritch Knight
- **Background:** Sage
- **Skills:** Intimidation and Athletics
- **Abilities (target):** STR 16 / DEX 10 / CON 14 / INT 16 / WIS 8 / CHA 10

### Best race choice notes
- Zariel Tiefling is recommended because you gain Darkvision and Fire Resistance, giving strong offensive and defensive capabilities.
- A secondary choice is the Githyanki because of their inherent mobility skills/spells and skill proficiency.
- Half-Orc is also a good choice for those who want a melee-only build.

### Best skills
- Intimidation (dialogue checks if you lead conversations)
- Athletics (shove, resist shove)

### Class features & mechanics (quick reference)
- Primary Ability: Strength
- Armour Proficiency: Light, Medium, and Heavy
- Weapon Proficiency: Simple, Martial, and Shield
- Health Points: 10 HP + Constitution modifier; then 6 HP + Constitution modifier per level
- Second Wind (Level 1)
- Action Surge (Level 2)
- Spellcasting (subclass at Level 3)

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- You will feel weak until level 5 where you gain Extra Attack.
- Priority: heavy armour, a one-hand weapon + shield, and a ranged weapon (bow/crossbow).
- If you aren’t using Lae’zel, take her early gear for survivability and a strong ranged option.
- Hoard potions, arrows, and consumables.
- Look to acquire Elixir of Hill Giant Strength, Potion of Speed, and Oil of Accuracy consumables (these “stack”).
- Overall priority list:
  - Complete Prologue
  - Recruit Companions
  - Unlock Withers; respec companions to proper class/ability score
  - Collect the Necromancy of Thay (important in Act 3)
  - Reach Druid Grove
  - Sell, stock up, complete quests
  - Unlock summons: Scratch and Shovel
  - Progress to level 5
  - Reach Underdark and Grymforge
  - Check all Permanent Bonuses in Act 1 and the best Gear

## Level-by-level progression (Fighter 1 → 12)

### Level 1 — Fighter 1
**Gain**
- Protection Fighting Style
- Second Wind

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Default turn: close to melee and attack; keep a ranged weapon equipped for turns you can’t reach.
- Use Second Wind as a bonus action so you can heal and still attack in the same turn.

### Level 2 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- Action Surge

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Use Action Surge for critical moments or to gain an advantage over tough opponents.
- Short Rest to replenish Action Surge; Long Rest refills Short Rests.

### Level 3 — Fighter 3 (Eldritch Knight)
**Subclass**
- Eldritch Knight

**Gain**
- Spellcasting (subclass feature)
- Weapon Bond (main-hand weapon can’t be knocked away; returns when thrown)
- Cantrips: Blade Ward, Fire Bolt
- Spells: Shield, Protection from Evil and Good
- Find Familiar (recommended utility spell in the guide)

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Play like a normal Fighter: aggressive, melee attacks up close and personal.
- Use your limited spell slots sparingly; treat magic as “defensive/utility” and keep weapon attacks as the main plan.

### Level 4 — Fighter 4
**Gain**
- Feat: Magic Initiative: Cleric
- Cantrips: Guidance, Produce Flame
- Spells: Thunderwave, Shield of Faith
- +1 spell learned (Eldritch Knight)

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Still do most of your damage with melee attacks; use utility to help positioning or survival.
- Use knockback tools when you can convert it into safety or a ledge advantage.

### Level 5 — Fighter 5
**Gain**
- Extra Attack (two attacks per Attack action)
- Replace Spells (swap spells on level-up / respec)

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Default turn: Attack action every round (now two attacks), then use bonus action on survival/utility when needed.
- You start to shine here: higher actions per turn means more consistent weapon damage.

### Level 6 — Fighter 6
**Gain**
- Feat: Ability Improvement Strength (+2 Strength for a total of 18)

**Play style (Level 6)**
- No major gameplay change: keep melee pressure high while using spells for utility.
- Before moving to Act 2: visit traders, stock supplies, and consider Grymforge (Adamantine) crafting.

### Level 7 — Fighter 7
**Gain**
- War Magic (after you cast a cantrip, you can make a weapon attack using a bonus action)
- Spells: Shatter and Darkness
- Replace Spell

**Play style (Level 7)**
- If you use a cantrip, follow up with a bonus-action weapon attack to keep your total attacks high.
- Use control/area tools sparingly; your reliable output remains weapon attacks.

### Level 8 — Fighter 8
**Gain**
- Feat: Shield Master
- Spell: Mirror Image

**Play style (Level 8)**
- You are now extremely hard to hit for a few turns: when fights are dangerous, prioritize survivability and keep swinging.
- Stay in melee range and protect allies by staying close (your reaction-based defense style matters more now).

### Level 9 — Fighter 9
**Gain**
- Indomitable (reroll a failed saving throw)

**Play style (Level 9)**
- No loop change: keep pressure with melee attacks.
- Use your reroll to avoid losing turns to control effects.

### Level 10 — Fighter 10
**Gain**
- Eldritch Strike (weapon hit gives Disadvantage on target’s next saving throw vs your spell before end of next turn)
- Cantrip: Mage Hand
- Spell: Gust of Wind

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Keep doing weapon attacks first; you can spread hits to set up easier saves when you do use control.
- Use utility to manage positioning and keep enemies off balance.

### Level 11 — Fighter 11
**Gain**
- Improved Extra Attack (three attacks per Attack action)
- Spell: Melf’s Acid Arrow

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Your identity becomes “action-heavy”: spend actions attacking to maximize weapon damage output.
- Use extra actions (Action Surge + speed effects) to pile on attacks when you need to burst down a target.

### Level 12 — Fighter 12
**Gain**
- Feat: Tough (HP maximum increases by 2 per level; +24 HP at level 12)
- Replace Spell

**Play style (Level 12)**
- You should be obnoxious to kill: maintain melee pressure while leaning on defenses to outlast enemies.
- Use scrolls/consumables for extra area damage or utility when your slots feel limited.

---

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
### Alternative Eldritch Fighter Build – Spellcaster Playstyle
- For Fighters looking to expand versatility with added spellcasting and damage potential, a one-level dip into Warlock (Hexblade subclass) at Level 12 is a strong option.
- This dip comes at the cost of one feat, but you can still easily reach 20 Strength and take the Great Weapon Master feat.
- Starting with 17 Strength at character creation allows you to hit 20 with Auntie Ethel’s bonus in Act 1.
- This hybrid setup gives excellent melee damage, ranged capabilities, and added magical utility.
