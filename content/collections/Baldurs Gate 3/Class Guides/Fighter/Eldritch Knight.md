## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- The Eldritch Knight subclass grants the pure physical melee Fighter class the ability to cast spells.
- This hybrid playstyle provides new defensive and self-healing spells and cantrips.
- Fighters have a high hit point pool and access to a variety of armor and weapons, making them very durable in combat.

### Core Playstyle
- Play aggressively as a melee Fighter, using spellcasting mainly for defense/utility (raising AC, niche protection, limited healing/utility) while relying on physical attacks for most damage.

### Party Role
- Front-line melee damage dealer with high actions per turn (Extra Attack + Action Surge).
- Durable “charger” that benefits from support, ranged damage, or stealth attacks from companions.
- Utility/control support through limited spellcasting and battlefield tools (knockback, obscuring, area damage).

### Pros
- High Damage
- Good Survivability
- Allows Some Spellcasting

### Cons
- Less DPS than Battle Master
- Not good for dialogue Ability Checks
- Low on Spell Slots

### Power Spikes
- Level 2: Action Surge
- Level 5: Extra Attack
- Level 7: War Magic
- Level 11: Improved Extra Attack

## Character Creation
- Race: Zariel Tiefling
- Class: Fighter
- Subclass: Eldritch Knight
- Background: Sage
- Ability Scores:
  - STR: 16
  - DEX: 10
  - CON: 14
  - INT: 16
  - WIS: 8
  - CHA: 10
- Proficiencies: Intimidation and Athletics

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Second Wind
  - Protection Fighting Style
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Aim to pick up a One Hand Weapon and Shield.
    - Lae’zel comes equipped with very high Armour Class (AC) medium armor and this is great to use until you can upgrade to heavy chain or plate mail.
    - Pick up a crossbow for ranged attacks.
    - Second Wind is a bonus action self-heal, allowing you to heal and attack in one turn.
    - Protection Fighting Style lets you use your reaction to impose disadvantage on an attack roll against a nearby ally (requires a shield).
    - Early gameplay is very simple: attack and heal yourself to survive; use potions if you expend Second Wind.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Action Surge
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Action Surge grants one additional action and is replenished on a Short Rest (can be done twice).
    - You now have a way to get two attacks in one turn along with a self-heal; play aggressively and charge in.
    - Don’t forget to equip a bow because you want some type of range weapon when melee isn’t an option because of distance.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Eldritch Knight
  - Spellcasting
  - Weapon Bond
  - Cantrips: Blade Ward, Fire Bolt
  - Spells: Shield, Protection from Evil and Good, Find Familiar
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Shield
  - Protection from Evil and Good
  - Find Familiar
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Use spells sparingly until you get more spell slots.
    - Ideally Shield and Find Familiar are the two you want to run all the time.
    - Cast Find Familiar outside of combat every long rest.
    - Use Blade Ward when you expect you or an ally to get chunked with melee damage.
    - Fire Bolt mainly to light something on fire; ranged bow/crossbow will do more damage.
    - Protection from Evil and Good is niche for specific enemy types; inspect enemies to check types.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Feat: Magic Initiative: Cleric
  - Cantrips (from feat): Guidance, Produce Flame
  - Spells (from feat): Thunderwave, Shield of Faith
  - Additional level 1 spell (Eldritch Knight progression noted as “an additional level 1 spell”)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Thunderwave
  - Shield of Faith
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Guidance is an outside-of-combat boost to Ability Checks and helps in story progression.
    - Produce Flame is utility for light; creatures lacking Darkvision receive a penalty in dark areas.
    - Thunderwave is used as knockback off ledges or to peel for an ally; don’t use it for damage.
    - Shield of Faith is a bonus action, requires concentration, lasts until long rest; cast it after a long rest alongside your Familiar for two buffs.
    - Damage still comes from melee attacks; heals aren’t selected here because scaling is determined on a lower ability.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Extra Attack
  - Replace Spells
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Extra Attack allows two attacks when you take the Attack action on your turn.
    - Replace Spells lets you swap spells (only each level or by respecing your entire class).
    - Gameplay remains similar but expect more damage being able to attack twice; Fighter starts to shine with high actions per turn.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Strength for a total of 18)
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Keeping the damage high along with spells for utility is the play here.
    - No other gameplay changes at level 6.
    - By Level 6, you should be close to finishing Act 1 content:
      - Visit traders and stock up on camp and alchemy supplies.
      - Find the best Act 1 items and permanent bonuses.
      - Grymforge has powerful armor and weapons (Adamantine) that can be used well into Act 3; collect and use the crafting items before moving on to Act 2 because you won’t be able to come back to this map.

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - War Magic
  - Spells: Shatter, Darkness
  - Replace Spell
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Shatter
  - Darkness
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - War Magic: After you cast a cantrip, you can make a weapon attack using a bonus action.
    - War Magic allows you to use a cantrip while still using your bonus action for attacking, keeping actions per turn high.
    - Use Darkness to shutdown range targets; note it can also mess with your ability to land attacks.
    - Use Shatter when you need area damage, especially if there are three or more enemies in a tight area.

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Feat: Shield Master
  - Spell: Mirror Image
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mirror Image
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Shield Master: +2 bonus to Dexterity Saving Throws while wielding a shield; reaction to diminish spell damage on Dexterity Saving Throws (half on failed, none on successful).
    - Mirror Image: creates 3 duplicates; each duplicate increases your Armour Class by 3; duplicates disappear when you successfully evade attacks.
    - Use Mirror Image when you need super high survivability for a few turns.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Indomitable
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Indomitable: Whenever you fail a Saving Throw, you can roll again, using the new result instead.
    - Passive survivability increase; requires zero action.

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Eldritch Strike
  - Cantrip: Mage Hand
  - Spell: Gust of Wind
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Gust of Wind
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Eldritch Strike: When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, it has Disadvantage on its next Saving Throw against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.
    - Mage Hand (Eldritch Knight): spectral hand is invisible and can carry out additional tasks; utility for outside-of-combat actions and thievery.
    - Gust of Wind: clears sounds and pushes creatures back 5m, forcing them Off Balance; strong area knockback similar to and a bit better than Thunderwave.
    - You can hit multiple creatures to apply disadvantage using extra attacks.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Improved Extra Attack
  - Spell: Melf’s Acid Arrow
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Melf’s Acid Arrow
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Improved Extra Attack: You can make two additional attacks after attacking with your main-hand weapon.
    - Action-heavy turn potential: multiple actions, then two more, plus Action Surge for another action.
    - You can add to this effect with a Potion of Haste or a scroll of Haste.
    - Melf’s Acid Arrow is used to strip armor with acid damage rather than its ranged damage potential, especially against heavily armored opponents.

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Feat: Tough
  - Replace Spell
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Tough: hit point maximum increases by 2 for every level you have gained (increase by 24 at level 12, giving 136 health at max level as stated).
    - Combined with heavy armour and high AC, the build is very hard to kill.
    - Pair Mirror Image or Shield when attacked to make it very hard to land a shot on this build.
    - Supplement area damage with scrolls you can find in chests and bookcases.

## Features and Mechanics
- The Eldritch Knight subclass grants the pure physical melee Fighter class the ability to cast spells, creating a hybrid playstyle with defensive and self-healing spells and cantrips, but with the downside that the Eldritch Knight will sacrifice some damage potential and has a shallow pool of spell slots.
- To avoid crippling the raw strength of the Fighter too much, consider Intelligence as a secondary priority; use spells to increase Armour Class (AC) or provide a little self-healing, relying on physical attacks for most damage.
- Fighter class features include:
  - Primary Ability: Strength
  - Armour Proficiency: Light, Medium, and Heavy
  - Weapon Proficiency: Simple, Martial, and Shield
  - Health Points: 10 HP + Constitution Modifier, then gain 6 HP + Constitution Modifier every level thereafter
  - Second Wind: Heal yourself with a bonus action (level 1)
  - Action Surge: Gain one additional action (level 2)
  - Extra Attack: Make an additional free attack after making an unarmed or weapon attack
- Eldritch Knight spellcasting mechanics:
  - Cantrips: cast infinitely, don’t take spell slots
  - Spell Slots: finite uses until a long rest
  - Learned Spells: opportunities at leveling up to unlearn and learn new spells
  - Concentration: requires maintaining concentration or the effect ends
- Eldritch Knight subclass features called out in leveling:
  - Weapon Bond (level 3): bound weapon can’t be knocked out of your hand; returns when thrown
  - War Magic (level 7): after casting a cantrip, make a weapon attack using a bonus action
  - Eldritch Strike (level 10): weapon hit imposes Disadvantage on next Saving Throw vs your spell before end of next turn
  - Indomitable (level 9): reroll failed Saving Throw
  - Improved Extra Attack (level 11): two additional attacks after attacking with main-hand weapon

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Initial Turn: Make sure your initial move either puts you in melee range so you can strike or attack with range weapon.
2. Bonus Action: make use of your bonus action with skills like Pommel or even shove to knock back enemies.
3. Potion of Speed: use these potions to gain bigger movement and more actions in challenging fights.
4. Long Rest: Make sure to rest when your spell slots are low.
5. Equip Range: Find and equip a bow early because it will increase your kill potential and take advantage of Fighters weapon versatility.
6. Make use of Action Surge: Action Surge is a powerful ability unique to Fighters. Save Action Surge for critical moments in combat or to gain an advantage over tough opponents.
7. Action and Bonus Actions: at level 7 you can use bonus action for attack after casting a cantrip.
8. Buff: consider using your buffs and damage avoidance spells on either the weakest companion or yourself when charging in.
9. Familiar: Always cast this and shield of faith after a long rest because it will stay with you until another long rest.
10. Crowd Control: the main source of your crowd control will come from consumables, Thunderwave and weapon skills.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative Eldritch Fighter Build – Spellcaster Playstyle:
  - A one-level dip into Warlock (specifically the Hexblade subclass) at Level 12 is presented as a strong option for Fighters looking to expand versatility with added spellcasting and damage potential.
  - With a single level, you gain bonus action utility, two solid spells, and a powerful ranged cantrip.
  - This dip comes at the cost of one feat, but you can still easily reach 20 Strength and take the Great Weapon Master feat.
  - Starting with 17 Strength at character creation allows you to hit 20 with Auntie Ethel’s bonus in Act 1.
- Alternative leveling table (as listed):
  - Level 1 Fighter: Great Weapon Fighting
  - Level 3 Fighter: Subclass: Eldritch Knight, Booming Blade, Friends, Shield, Thunderwave, Longstrider
  - Level 4 Fighter: Feat: +2 STR, Chromatic Orb
  - Level 6 Fighter: Feat: Great Weapon Master
  - Level 8 Fighter: Feat: Savage Attacker, Misty Step
  - Level 10 Fighter: Firebolt, Protection from Good and Evil
  - Level 11 Fighter: Scorching Ray
  - Level 12 Warlock: Hexblade Subclass, Eldritch Blast, Toll of the Dead, Hexed, Hellish Rebuke

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- The most significant change affecting character builds in Patch 8 is the introduction of 12 new subclasses.
- The Eldritch Knight Fighter sees a major boost in power with the inclusion of the Booming Blade cantrip, enhancing each of the Fighter’s actions with additional thunder damage and increasing overall damage output.
- A Patch 8 note indicates you can use 11 levels of Eldritch Knight Fighter and 1 Warlock to gain more spellcasting potential, extra utility and control when playing solo, while only sacrificing one feat; a one level Hexblade Warlock option is also discussed as adding utility with the same premise of losing one feat.

### Patch 7
- The Eldritch Knight subclass and Fighter class did not receive any changes to combat and gameplay with the release of Patch 7.
- The overall focus of Patch 7 was adding mods and new endings with more honour mode boss actions, including a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager, and several new cinematic endings (most focusing on evil endings).
- This best Eldritch Knight Fighter Build Guide remains unchanged in Patch 7.
