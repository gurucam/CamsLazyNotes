## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- The Arcane Archer presents a unique way to play the Fighter Class because you can empower your ranged attacks with “Arcane Shots.”
- These shots use the Arcane Arrows resource and add an effect like force, psychic, or necrotic damage.
- Moreover, you can knock back enemies, shoot through them for AoE damage, and even banish a target.
- Expect this to be a different way to play a Fighter class in Baldur’s Gate 3 with high Dexterity, bows, and medium armor or clothing.
- The strength of the Arcane Archer resides in its spellcasting and ranged attacks.
- With high Dexterity, you can pickpocket, steal, and disarm traps.
- However, the downside is you will need to play at range to optimize this subclass, and while you have cantrips, they are relatively weak.
- Moreover, this subclass will be Dexterity-based rather than Strength-based, which may seem odd for traditional Fighter builds.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Open from stealth, spend your early actions on high-damage ranged attacks, and use your special shots to control groups or delete one priority target per turn while stacking extra actions for burst turns.**

### Party role
- **Ranged damage dealer:** consistent bow damage with big burst turns when resources are stacked.
- **Ranged control / utility:** special shots add knockback, AoE, debuffs, and banish-style control.
- **Dexterity utility:** lockpicking, pickpocketing, stealth, and trap disarming support.

### Pros
- Can Lockpick and Pickpocket
- Ranged Damage
- Spellcasting

### Cons
- Ranged Focus
- Weak Cantrips
- Low Survivability

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: extra action per short rest for early burst turns
- Level 3: Arcane Archer subclass + Arcane Arrows + first Arcane Shots
- Level 4: big ranged damage feat spike
- Level 5: Extra Attack (2 attacks per action)
- Level 7: Curving Shot + Magic Arrow + more Arcane Arrows / Shots
- Level 11: Improved Extra Attack (3 attacks per action)
- Level 12: Wizard multiclass for extra utility spells

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** High Half-Elf
- **Class:** Fighter
- **Subclass:** Arcane Archer
- **Background:** Urchin
- **Skills:** Athletics and Acrobatics
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 17 / CON 16 / INT 14 / WIS 10 / CHA 8

### Race choice notes
- High Half-Elf is the best choice for an Arcane Archer Fighter build because it provides an extra cantrip, giving you more spellcasting potential.
- Alternatively, you can use a Githyanki if you prefer more mobility or a Drow if you want Superior Darkvision.

### Recommended background
- Urchin is the best background for an Arcane Archer Fighter in Baldur’s Gate 3 because you gain proficiency in two Dexterity skills, Sleight of Hand and Stealth.
- A second choice is Criminal which also gives bonuses to Dexterity skills.

### Ability score notes
- Dexterity is the best ability score to increase with the Arcane Archer because the build uses ranged weapons that scale based on Dexterity.
- Unlike traditional Fighter builds, the Arcane Archer can lower strength to 8 and increase Intelligence used for cantrips and spells.
- Therefore, set your ability scores in the character creator to 17 Dexterity, 16 Constitution, and 14 Intelligence.
- If you want more strength, simply find the Club of Hill Giant Strength in Act 1 or use Elixir of Hill Giant Strength to gain Strength.
- This combination is particularly effective in Act 1 when using the Titanstring Bow.

### Recommended skills
- Athletics and Acrobatics are the best skills for the Arcane Archer Fighter in Baldur’s Gate 3 because you resist being shoved.
- Most skills do not influence combat, and these two are recommended if you have low strength and high dexterity.
- Moreover, the Urchin Background will grant Stealth and Sleight of Hand, so if you select a different background, pick those.

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
### Arcane Archer Fighter Build – Spellcaster Playstyle
For Fighter builds seeking increased spellcasting versatility and damage output, consider switching to the Eldritch Knight subclass. Additionally, you’ll want to invest at level into Hexblade Warlock. This addition provides valuable bonus action utility, access to two strong spells, and a potent ranged cantrip.

Although Warlock is a Charisma-based class, the benefits it offers significantly enhance a Fighter’s toolkit, at the cost of just one feat. You can still comfortably reach 20 Strength and pick up Great Weapon Master with your remaining feats. If you begin with 17 Strength at character creation and plan to secure Auntie Ethel’s +1 bonus in Act 1, you’ll hit 20 Strength without issue. This hybrid build offers excellent melee damage, enhanced ranged capabilities, and added magical flexibility, making it a versatile and potent take on the Fighter archetype.
