## Features and Mechanics
- The Arcane Archer empowers ranged attacks with “Arcane Shots.”
- Arcane Shots use the Arcane Arrows resource and add an effect like force, psychic, or necrotic damage.
- You can knock back enemies, shoot through them for AoE damage, and even banish a target.
- Expect a Dexterity-based Fighter with bows and medium armor or clothing.
- The strength of the Arcane Archer resides in its spellcasting and ranged attacks.
- With high Dexterity, you can pickpocket, steal, and disarm traps.
- The downside is you will need to play at range to optimize this subclass, and while you have cantrips, they are relatively weak.

## Subclass Options

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Optimize Actions per turn with Elixir of Blood Lust, Potion of Speed, and Action Surge.
- Combining these three, you gain four actions, each allowing you to attack three times.
- Each attack can use an Arcane Arrow; prioritize killing one target per turn to trigger Elixir of Bloodlust.
- Use a combination of elemental arrows like arrows of many targets, with Arcane Arrows to do AOE damage, debuff, knockback, or crowd control.
- Before combat begins, go into stealth and coat your weapon with Oil of Accuracy or poison.
- Do this in turn base mode, reset your turn to gain a bonus action, and initiate combat.
- This will trigger a surprise, giving you a free extra round in combat.
- Use Action Surge on turn one if you can take out multiple targets, and use your spells pre-fight or Shield during combat.
- Short rest after each combat encounter to replenish both Arcane Arrows and Action Surge resources; long rest when short rests aren’t available.
- Start stocking up on alchemy ingredients and craft elixir of blood lust and potions of speed; use these in tough combat encounters for even more actions.

## Alternative Build Route
- Patch 8 note: The Eldritch Knight Fighter sees a major boost in power this Patch with the inclusion of the Booming Blade cantrip. Therefore, multiclassing the Fighter with Warlock is now a very powerful combination.
- This alternative is an Eldritch Knight/Hexblade Warlock combo for those looking for top-tier DPS.
- Summary (as stated):
  - Switching to Eldritch Knight increases spellcasting versatility and damage output.
  - Invest 1 level into Hexblade Warlock for bonus action utility, access to two strong spells, and a potent ranged cantrip.
  - Although Warlock is a Charisma-based class, the benefits significantly enhance a Fighter’s toolkit, at the cost of just one feat.
  - You can still comfortably reach 20 Strength and pick up Great Weapon Master with remaining feats.
  - If you begin with 17 Strength at character creation and plan to secure Auntie Ethel’s +1 bonus in Act 1, you’ll hit 20 Strength without issue.
  - This hybrid build offers excellent melee damage, enhanced ranged capabilities, and added magical flexibility.
