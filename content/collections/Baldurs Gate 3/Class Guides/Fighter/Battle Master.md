## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- The Battle Master Fighter is the epitome of powerful melee combat. Unlike other builds, the Fighter doesn’t have to multiclass at higher levels to gain combat power.
- You gain improved extra attacks, resulting in three attacks per one action. This gives the Fighter a unique advantage in combat, which, when fully optimized, can generate four actions in one turn.
- With each action fueling 3 attacks, the Battle Master can dish out some of the highest damage in BG3.
- The Fighter’s downside is a lack of spell casting, lower dexterity, and vulnerability to stuns. Moreover, you won’t have other classes’ dialogue or exploration bonuses, but can make up for it in pure raw damage.
- This build uses the Battle Master subclass, which gains extra resources for maneuvers to be used in combat. These maneuvers give you on-demand crowd control, knockback, and extra damage.
- Consider this the strongest Fighter subclass and build, and one of the best in the game due to damage and ease of play.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Play aggressively: open by closing distance (or using a ranged weapon if you can’t), then chain as many weapon attacks as possible each turn while spending maneuvers for control and saving your burst actions for critical moments.**

### Party role
- **Frontline damage dealer:** charges in melee range and deletes priority targets.
- **On-demand control:** maneuvers give you crowd control, knockback, and extra damage.
- **Action economy burst:** Action Surge (and later extra attacks per action) lets you swing the fight in a single turn.

### Pros
- One of the highest damage outputs in BG3 when fully optimized
- Straightforward playstyle, very effective, and ultra simple to play
- Excellent action economy: multiple actions, multiple attacks per action, and burst windows

### Cons
- Lack of spell casting
- Lower dexterity (initiative weakness)
- Vulnerability to stuns / control, especially if you go late in the round

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Action Surge** (very early double-action burst)
- Level 3: **Battle Master** (Superiority Dice + maneuvers = control + damage)
- Level 4: **Great Weapon Master** (bonus-action follow-ups + big damage toggle)
- Level 5: **Extra Attack** (turns start to explode)
- Level 8: **Alert** (patches the “go late” weakness)
- Level 11: **Improved Extra Attack** (3 attacks per action)

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Half-Orc
- **Class:** Fighter
- **Subclass:** Battle Master
- **Background:** Soldier
- **Skills:** Acrobatics and Perception
- **Abilities (target):** STR 16 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 8 / WIS 10 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Half-Orc)
- The best race choice for a Battle Master Fighter build in BG3, is the Half-Orc or Duergar Dwarf.
- The Half-Orc’s innate abilities, including Darkvision, Savage Attack, and Relentless Endurance, make it an ideal choice.

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* Duergar Dwarf (Enlarge Spell and Invisibility aids in damage and defensive capabilities).

### Starting setup
- Primary Ability: Strength
- Armour Proficiency: Light, Medium, and Heavy
- Weapon Proficiency: Simple, Martial, and Shield
- Preferred Armor: Heavy
- Preferred Weapon: Greatsword
- Health Points: 10 HP + their Constitution Modifier, and then gain 6 HP + their Constitution Modifier every level thereafter.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- At the start of the game, you will feel weak until level 5 where you gain Extra Attack.
- Your priority for the solo Fighter build is locating heavy armour, a two-handed Greatsword, and a Longbow or Heavy Crossbow.
- Lae’zel, who you meet in the prologue has powerful medium armour with 15 AC along with a Heavy Crossbow. If you don’t plan on using this companion, take her gear immediately and equip it for a big boost in overall survivability and ranged damage.
- From this point, you need to hoard potions, arrows, and consumables.
- The advantage of the Fighter is not needing constant long rest.
- Elixir of Bloodlust or Colossus lasts until a long rest and drastically increases your damage.
- The Arrows of Ice and others are particularly helpful when you are unable to stun or knock enemies prone early on.
- Your overall priority with this build is the following:
  - Complete Prologue
  - Recruit Other Companions
  - Reached Emerald Grove
  - Sell, Stock up, complete main quest
  - Unlock Withers, respec companions if needed
  - Progress to level 5
  - Reach Underdark and Grymforge

## Level-by-level progression (Fighter 1 → 12)
> Keep your turn simple: use your action to attack, use maneuvers when you need control or to secure a kill, and save burst resources for the moments that matter.

### Level 1 — Fighter 1
**Gain**
- Great Weapon Fighting: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack with a Two-Handed melee weapon, that die is rerolled once.
- Second Wind: You regain 1d10 + Fighter Level hit points.

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Use your action to make weapon attacks; save your bonus action for healing when needed (potion or Second Wind).
- Keep a ranged weapon equipped so you can still attack when melee isn’t an option because of distance.

### Level 2 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- Action Surge: gain one additional action.

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Play aggressively and charge in, using Action Surge when you need another full action to swing a fight.
- Short Rest to replenish this resource.

### Level 3 — Fighter 3 (Battle Master)
**Subclass**
- Battle Master

**Gain**
- Battle Master Subclass Unlocked: access to Superiority Dice (d8s) and select three maneuvers.
- Disarming Attack: Spend a superiority die to make an attack that deals an additional 1d8 damage and possibly forces the target to drop the weapons they are holding.
- Trip Attack: Spend a superiority die to make an attack that deals an additional 1d8 damage and possibly knocks the target Prone. The target must be Large or smaller.
- Riposte: When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, expend a superiority die to retaliate with a powerful strike that deals an additional 1d8 damage.

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Use maneuvers early in combat when you need control (disarm, prone) or when a reaction hit is “free value” (riposte).
- Short Rest after every battle if possible to replenish your resources.

### Level 4 — Fighter 4
**Gain**
- Feat: Great Weapon Master

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Start turns by attacking with your action; aim to secure kills so Great Weapon Master fuels a bonus-action follow-up.
- Toggle the high-risk damage mode off if your hit chance feels too low, and lean on consistent attacks until accuracy improves.

### Level 5 — Fighter 5
**Gain**
- Extra Attack: Allows you to make two attacks when you take the Attack action on your turn.

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Default loop: attack twice with Extra Attack, then convert kills/critical hits into a bonus-action follow-up when available.
- Save burst resources for priority targets: you can chain multiple attacks in one turn by stacking extra actions.

### Level 6 — Fighter 6
**Gain**
- Feat: Ability Improvement Strength (+2 Strength for a total of 18).

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Keep the same attack loop, but lean harder into the damage toggle when your accuracy is higher.
- Around Level 6, you should be close to transitioning out of Act 1: check merchants, stock up on camp and alchemy supplies, find the best Act 1 items, and consider the Grymforge (Adamantine) before moving on.

### Level 7 — Fighter 7
**Gain**
- Precision Attack
- Pushing Attack

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Use Precision Attack to secure key hits when you need reliability on an opener or a critical target.
- Use Pushing Attack for simple knockback, including pushing enemies off ledges for kills.

### Level 8 — Fighter 8
**Gain**
- Feat: Alert

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Prioritize going early: opening with control or multiple kills reduces incoming damage significantly.
- You can’t be Surprised, which prevents catastrophic round-one nukes in dialogue-triggered fights.

### Level 9 — Fighter 9
**Gain**
- Indomitable: Whenever you fail a Saving Throw, you can roll again, using the new result instead.

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Keep your same damage plan, but expect more survivability against effects that would otherwise shut you down.

### Level 10 — Fighter 10
**Gain**
- Sweeping Attack
- Goading Attack

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Use Sweeping Attack when you need to hit multiple enemies at once.
- Use Goading Attack to pressure threats off fragile party members by imposing Disadvantage on attacks against anyone else.

### Level 11 — Fighter 11
**Gain**
- Improved Extra Attack: You can make two additional attacks after attacking with your main-hand weapon. This means, every action you spend on attacks, produces 3 attacks.

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Your identity is action-heavy burst: spend actions attacking, and convert early initiative into fight-ending tempo.
- Preserve key resources for turns where deleting priority targets prevents control effects or huge enemy damage.

### Level 12 — Fighter 12
**Gain**
- Feat: Ability Improvement Strength (+2 Strength to reach 20).

**Play style (Level 12)**
- You should feel insanely powerful: keep turns centered on chaining attacks, and use extra actions to erase the biggest threat immediately.
- Use consumables to push your action economy and movement when fights demand it.

---

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
### Alternative Battle Master Fighter Build – Spellcaster Playstyle
For Fighter builds seeking increased spellcasting versatility and damage output, consider switching to the Eldritch Knight subclass. Also, take a one-level dip into Warlock with the Hexblade subclass at Level 12. This dip provides valuable bonus action utility, access to two strong spells, and a potent ranged cantrip. While Warlock is a Charisma-based class, the benefits it offers significantly enhance a Fighter’s toolkit, at the cost of just one feat.

You can still comfortably hit 20 Strength and take Great Weapon Master with your available feats. Furthermore, if you start with 17 Strength during character creation and plan to earn Auntie Ethel’s bonus in Act 1, you’ll have an optimal setup. This build gives you strong melee and ranged damage options along with added utility, making for a well-rounded and powerful Fighter.
