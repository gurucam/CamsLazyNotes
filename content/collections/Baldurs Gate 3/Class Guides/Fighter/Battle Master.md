## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- The Battle Master Fighter is the epitome of powerful melee combat.
- Battle Masters are paragons of tactical superiority, combining combat manoeuvres and experience in the field to dominate every fight.
- These maneuvers give you on-demand crowd control, knockback, and extra damage.

### Core Playstyle
- Generate heavy turn-to-turn pressure through multiple attacks per action, using maneuvers sparingly for control when the situation calls for it.

### Party Role
- Melee damage dealer that can dish out some of the highest damage in BG3.
- On-demand crowd control via maneuvers (stun/prone, disarm, knockback).
- Durable front-liner with heavy armour, self-healing, and saving throw re-roll utility.

### Pros
- Does not have to multiclass at higher levels to gain combat power.
- Improved extra attacks resulting in three attacks per one action.
- Ultra simple to play and very effective.

### Cons
- Lack of spell casting.
- Lower dexterity and weakness of going way later in the round without investment.
- Vulnerability to stuns.

### Power Spikes
- Level 2: Action Surge (gain one additional action).
- Level 5: Extra Attack (two attacks when you take the Attack action) + Action Surge + Great Weapon Master synergy.
- Level 11: Improved Extra Attack (3 attacks per action).

## Character Creation

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Second Wind: You regain 1d10 + Fighter Level hit points.
  - Great Weapon Fighting: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack with a Two-Handed melee weapon, that die is rerolled once.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use your action to attack (melee if possible, ranged if distance prevents melee).
    - Turn 2+: Use Second Wind (bonus action) as needed; keep attacking.
  - Notes:
    - Second Wind uses a bonus action and replenishes on short rest.
    - Best weapon for the Fighter is a Two-Handed Greatsword; keep a ranged weapon equipped for when melee isn’t an option.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Action Surge: gain one additional action.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Play aggressively and charge in; use Action Surge to take multiple actions when needed.
    - Turn 2+: Continue aggressive attacks; keep a bow equipped for range.
  - Notes:
    - Action Surge replenishes on a Short Rest.
    - You now have a way to get two attacks in one turn along with a self-heal.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Battle Master
  - Superiority Dice (d8): 4 (Level 3)
  - Battle Manoeuvers (Level 3): choose three
  - Maneuvers selected:
    - Disarming Attack
    - Trip Attack
    - Riposte
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Disarming Attack or Trip Attack when you need control; otherwise attack normally.
    - Turn 2+: Use Riposte on misses (reaction) when appropriate; use Action Surge when you need another attack.
  - Notes:
    - Superiority Dice are a resource that fuels Battle Master manoeuvers and is expended upon use; you regain expended Superiority Dice after a Short or Long Rest.
    - With these maneuvers, you will have battlefield control early instead of mindlessly swinging your two-handed weapon.
    - You can also use Pommel Strike on a Greatsword to proc Daze as well.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Feat: Great Weapon Master
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Initiate combat using your action first, saving your bonus action for a Great Weapon Master attack (after a critical hit or kill).
    - Turn 2+: Focus on kills and critical strikes to trigger bonus action extra attack.
  - Notes:
    - Great Weapon Master: When a melee attack scores a critical hit or kills a creature, you can make another melee attack as a bonus action.
    - Great Weapon Master: When attacking with Heavy Weapons you are proficient with, attack rolls take a -5 penalty, but their damage increases by 10.
    - You can turn the -5/+10 portion off in the Passive section on your toolbar for more consistent damage at lower hit chances.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Extra Attack: Allows you to make two attacks when you take the Attack action on your turn.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Attack twice with Extra Attack; if you kill an enemy or critical strike, attack again with Great Weapon Master (bonus action).
    - Turn 2+: Use Action Surge to attack another two times when needed; use superiority dice attacks sparingly when the situation calls for it.
  - Notes:
    - In one turn, you can attack twice with Extra Attack, kill an enemy or critical strike, and attack again with Great Weapon Master (three).
    - You use Action Surge and attack another two times for a total of 5 in one turn.
    - You can make it 7 by either using a Potion of Speed or having someone cast Haste on you (another action once per turn).

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement Strength (+2 Strength for a total of 18)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Keep Great Weapon Master on if your hit chance supports it; attack repeatedly.
    - Turn 2+: Continue multiple attacks; use Action Surge for critical moments.
  - Notes:
    - This helps you hit harder and be more likely to land hits, which is especially handy with Great Weapon Master.
    - If Great Weapon Master was toggled off due to low hit chances, turn it back on.
    - Around Level 6, check merchants and stock up on camp and alchemy supplies; Grymforge has powerful armor and weapons (Adamantine) that can be used well into Act 3.

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Battle Manoeuvers (Level 7): choose two more
  - Maneuvers selected:
    - Precision Attack
    - Pushing Attack
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Precision Attack as a big opener after long resting; use Pushing Attack for knockback kills or control.
    - Turn 2+: Continue crowd control when needed; otherwise keep attacking.
  - Notes:
    - Precision Attack: Your next weapon attack gets an Attack Roll bonus equal to your Superiority Die; it doesn’t require an action, just a superiority die resource, and lasts until a long rest.
    - Pushing Attack: Possibly push the target back 4.5m; can be used in melee or ranged.

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Feat: Alert
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Open early in the round to crowd control or kill high-damage dealers.
    - Turn 2+: Keep pressure with attacks; capitalize on going first/sooner.
  - Notes:
    - Alert: You gain a +5 bonus to Initiative and can’t be Surprised.
    - Being Surprised can skip a round for you; this feat prevents missing one turn in dialogue-based combat starts.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Indomitable: Whenever you fail a Saving Throw, you can roll again, using the new result instead.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Continue standard attack pressure.
    - Turn 2+: Use Indomitable when you fail a Saving Throw.
  - Notes:
    - Simple passive feature that helps increase survivability and requires zero action by the player.

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Battle Manoeuvers (Learned at 10): choose two more
  - Maneuvers selected:
    - Sweeping Attack
    - Goading Attack
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Sweeping Attack when you need to hit multiple targets in one action.
    - Turn 2+: Use Goading Attack when allies (like a Wizard or spellcaster) are being harassed by a damage dealer.
  - Notes:
    - Sweeping Attack provides area-based AOE damage (useful due to Fighter lack of area damage outside of Cleave skill from weapon).
    - Goading Attack gives the target Disadvantage on attacking any other creature.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Improved Extra Attack: You can make two additional attacks after attacking with your main-hand weapon (3 attacks per action).
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Spend actions on attacks to produce 3 attacks per action; use Action Surge to add another action of attacks.
    - Turn 2+: Use Great Weapon Master bonus action attack after a critical hit or kill; maintain pressure.
  - Notes:
    - This makes the Fighter the most action-heavy class and build in Baldur’s Gate 3.
    - The build can add more actions via Potion of Speed or Haste; Alert is highlighted as powerful alongside this level’s output.

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement Strength (+2 Strength, improving Strength to 20)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use your full attack suite early to remove threats.
    - Turn 2+: Continue aggressive multi-attack pressure with maneuvers when needed.
  - Notes:
    - The guide’s alternative build route uses Level 12 as a Warlock dip instead (see Alternative Build Route).

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Battle Master Fighter Gameplay & Priorities:
  - At the start of the game, you will feel weak until level 5 where you gain Extra Attack.
  - Priority for the solo Fighter build: locating heavy armour, a two-handed Greatsword, and a Longbow or Heavy Crossbow.
  - Lae’zel has powerful medium armour with 15 AC along with a Heavy Crossbow; if you don’t plan on using this companion, take her gear immediately and equip it for a big boost in overall survivability and ranged damage.
  - Hoard potions, arrows, and consumables.
  - The advantage of the Fighter is not needing constant long rest.
  - Overall priority steps:
    - Complete Prologue
    - Recruit Other Companions
    - Reached Emerald Grove
    - Sell, Stock up, complete main quest
    - Unlock Withers, respec companions if needed
    - Progress to level 5
    - Reach Underdark and Grymforge
- 10 combat gameplay tips and tricks:
  1. Initial Turn: Make sure your initial move either puts you in melee range so you can strike or attack with a range weapon.
  2. Bonus Action: Make use of your bonus action with skills like Pommel or even shove to knock back enemies.
  3. Potion of Speed: Use these potions to gain movement and more actions in challenging fights.
  4. Rest: Make sure to rest when your superiority dies are low so you start with many available.
  5. Equip Range: Find and equip a bow early because it will increase your kill potential and take advantage of Fighters weapon versatility.
  6. Make use of Action Surge: Save Action Surge for critical moments in combat or to gain an advantage over tough opponents.
  7. Action and Bonus Actions: Try to make use of both your action and bonus action every turn, especially with Great Weapon Master.
  8. Maximize your Attacks: Consider using Action Surge for an additional set of attacks with Extra Attack after level 5.
  9. Weapon Selection: Use a Greatsword due to their secondary ability and bonuses in BG3.
  10. Utilize Maneuvers: Maneuvers are great for crowd control and should be used early in combat.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative Battle Master Fighter Build – Spellcaster Playstyle:
  - Consider switching to the Eldritch Knight subclass.
  - Take a one-level dip into Warlock with the Hexblade subclass at Level 12.
  - This dip provides valuable bonus action utility, access to two strong spells, and a potent ranged cantrip.
  - Benefits enhance a Fighter’s toolkit at the cost of just one feat.
  - If you start with 17 Strength during character creation and plan to earn Auntie Ethel’s bonus in Act 1, you’ll have an optimal setup.

  - Level 1 Fighter: Great Weapon Fighting
  - Level 2 Fighter: –

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- Patch 8 introduces 12 new subclasses, each bringing distinct strengths and new synergies to character builds.
- One standout change: significant boost to the Eldritch Knight Fighter, thanks to the effectiveness of the Booming Blade cantrip (bonus thunder damage and increased overall damage output).
- Multiclassing Fighter with Warlock has now become a very viable combo.
- The guide keeps the original pure Battle Master Fighter build for those who prefer that straightforward playstyle, and includes an alternative build below (11 Fighter / 1 Hexblade Warlock) for added versatility, especially effective for solo play.

### Patch 7
- The Battle Master Fighter didn’t get any updates in Patch 7 of BG3; everything about the class, like builds, combat, and how it plays, is basically the same.
- Patch 7 focus: mods (added a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager).
