## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- A Paladin subclass that draws its power and inspiration from the ancient forces of nature, light, and goodness.
- Guardians of the natural world and defenders against darkness and corruption, focused on preserving beauty, joy, and the balance of the world.
- A heavily armored warrior identity that still provides extra utility (healing and crowd control) while charging into melee range with heavy armor and two-handed weapons.

### Core Playstyle
- Charge into melee with heavy armor and a two-handed weapon, using limited spell resources for burst damage or utility while managing rests due to being spell slot starved.

### Party Role
- Extra utility in the group (decent healing and access to crowd-control abilities).
- Frontline melee damage dealer with high burst damage.
- Works best alongside ranged and support characters providing support, ranged damage, or stealth attacks.

### Pros
- Crowd Control
- High Burst Damage
- Heavy Armour

### Cons
- Spell Slot Starved
- Limited Spells
- Complex

### Power Spikes
- Level 1 – Healing Radiance
- Level 2 – Searing Smite
- Level 3 – Command
- Level 4 – Feat +2 Strength
- Level 5 – Branding Smite
- Level 6 – Magic Weapon
- Level 7 – Lesser Restoration
- Level 8 – Great Weapon Master
- Level 9 – Blinding Smite
- Level 10 – Aura of Courage
- Level 11 – Multiclass Fighter
- Level 12 – Action Surge

## Character Creation
- Race: Zariel Tiefling
- Class: Paladin
- Subclass: Oath of Ancients
- Background: Soldier (also listed in the Build Summary Guide as Noble)
- Ability Scores: STR 16, DEX 10, CON 14, INT 8, WIS 10, CHA 16
- Proficiencies:
  - Skills: Persuasion and Insight
  - Background (Soldier): Athletics and Intimidation

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Channeled Oath Charges: Paladin-specific resource that allows the casting of spells and abilities.
    - Usage: used for three oath skills, can be recovered via short rest.
  - Lay on Hands: Use your blessed touch to heal a creature or cure it of all diseases and poisons.
    - Usage: Single target melee heal using action or cure disease. This consumes Oath Charges but is an effective heal.
  - Divine Sense: Gain Advantage on Attack Rolls against celestials, fiends, and undead.
    - Usage: This uses bonus action which can be used with an attack costing an action.
  - Healing Radiance: Heal yourself and all nearby allies for 5 hit points. Regain another 5 hit points next turn.
    - Usage: This is a Channeled Oath skill that can heal using a bonus action which is very helpful because you can still use your action for damage or another heal.
  - Oath of the Ancient Tenets: Through acts of kindness, enkindle the light of hope in the bleakest hollows of despair. Shelter the Light.
    - Usage: this isn’t really a mechanic portion, just an oath you need to maintain. If you break the oath, you can unlock a new subclass, Oathbreaker.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use main weapon attack for damage; use Healing Radiance or Lay on Hands when healing is needed.
    - Turn 2+: Move along quickly to level 2 for spell unlocks; damage comes from the main weapon attack.
  - Notes:
    - In the early game just rely on weapon damage.
    - Your goal is to find some heavy armor and a two-handed weapon.
    - You can grab medium armor from Lae’zel in the introduction if you don’t plan on using her.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Divine Smite: uses spell slot and hits in conjunction with weapon strike.
    - Usage: Can be automatically applied, only during critical hits or have a popup box via the reactions menu. Be cautious at first about using this too often.
  - Great Weapon Fighting: passive feature when you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack with a Two-Handed melee weapon, that die is rerolled once.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Searing Smite
  - Thunderous Smite
  - Shield of Faith
  - Divine Favour
  - Cure Wounds
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Consider using Shield of Faith or Divine Favor prior to a fight (bonus action), then attack in melee.
    - Turn 2+: Use spell slots carefully; avoid wasting spell slots on weak targets and rely on melee attacks when needed.
  - Notes:
    - Divine Smite can proc (consuming an extra spell slot) and deliver extra damage in combination with Searing Smite (two spell slots on a critical strike).
    - Early in the game, this is an issue due to the lack of spell slots. So be careful.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Gain another level 1 spell slot up to three.
  - Gain one more prepared spell.
  - Divine Health: prevents the disease from affecting you (passive benefit).
  - Nature’s Wrath (subclass): Invoke primeval forces to Restrain an enemy.
    - Usage: great debuff if the enemy is in melee and weapon-based.
  - Turn the Faithless (subclass): Turn nearby fey and fiends.
    - Usage: use against fey and Fiends; examine the enemy and use it when the percentage is high, around 60% or so with 3 monsters for best usage.
  - Speak with Animals (subclass): Gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts.
    - Usage: helpful out-of-combat spell to trigger many quests with animals.
  - Ensnaring Strike (Ranged) (subclass): Your attack summons thorny vines that possibly Ensnare your target.
    - Usage: “an odd subclass skill” that the guide says to avoid; mainly used on Rangers and not a good fit for this build.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Searing Smite
  - Thunderous Smite
  - Shield of Faith
  - Divine Favour
  - Cure Wounds
  - Command
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:

    - Turn 2+: Decide on priority: if needing a stun, use Command; if needing to kill a target, use spell slots for Searing Smite; for high damage and a single target stun, Thunderous Smite.
  - Notes:
    - “Don’t be afraid to use your turn to chain both Healing Radiance and Cure Wounds.”
    - “Buff turn one, and use burst damage turn two. Turn three and evaluate what your group needs: crowd control, burst, healing, etc.”

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Spell Slots: use your spell slots wisely, especially for Divine Smite and Healing
2. Divine Smite: Use this extra damage source on the hardest to defeat enemies and save your spell slots for when you need it.
3. Healing: Use potions that consume bonus actions or Lay on Hands for yourself or an ally.
4. Heavy Armor: Find and equip this early for needed AC.
5. Crowd Control: Make sure to CC enemies with Thunderous Smite or a Companion ability to limit damage.
6. Pre-Buff: Cast Blessed before combat to get a roll Advantage.
7. Range: Don’t forget to equip a ranged weapon to ensure you can do damage on nearly every turn.
8. Long Rest: Use the rest at camp function to regain spell slots and don’t go into a fight with zero.
9. Great Weapon Master: Focus on low-health targets with your first action to strike a kill and another attack with Great Weapon Master.
10. Toggle Reactions: Make sure both Divine Smite and Great Weapon Master are toggled on or off when you need them.

## Alternative Build Route
For a stronger start in Act 1, consider a Warlock/Paladin multiclass build. Just two levels in Hexblade Warlock provide a powerful early-game foundation with strong melee scaling and spellcasting. After reaching level 3, switch to Paladin and choose the Oath of Vengeance subclass for increased mobility and burst damage. By level 5, this combo significantly boosts your melee potential and versatility. To round out the build, take levels in Fighter with the Eldritch Knight subclass, adding even more spellcasting utility and consistent weapon damage.

Level Class Selection
- 1 Warlock: Hexblade, Shield, Hellish Rebuke, Booming Blade, Eldritch Blast
- 2 Warlock: Wrathful Smite, Hex spells, One with Shadows, Devil’s Sight Invocations
- 3 Paladin: Multiclass Paladin, Vengeance Subclass
- 4 Paladin: Great Weapon Fighting, Command, Thunderous Smite, Divine Favour, Shield of Faith, Cure Wounds
- 5 Paladin: Protection from Good and Evil
- 6 Paladin: Great Weapon Master Feat, Compelled Duel
- 7 Paladin: Drop Compelled, select Magic Weapon, Lesser Restoration
- 8 Paladin: Aid spell
- 9 Fighter: Multiclass Fighter, Defense Fighting Style
- 10 Fighter: Action Surge
- 11 Fighter: Eldritch Knight subclass, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile spells, Bursting Sinew, Fire Bolt cantrips, Longstrider extended
- 12 Fighter: Savage Attacker feat, Shield spell

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- The biggest changes to the Oath of the Ancients Paladin build come from the addition of new subclasses, spells, and cantrips.
- While three enemies have been buffed in Tactician and Honour modes, including Balthazar, the overall flow of combat remains largely the same.
- Booming Blade now offers a notable advantage by adding thunder damage to each attack, making it a strong option.
- In the alternative build, the guide multiclasses into Warlock “just to pick up this powerful cantrip.”

### Patch 7
- The Oath of the Ancients Paladin class didn’t receive any balance changes in Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 7.
- The big focus of this patch was on mods: Larian Studios introduced a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager.
