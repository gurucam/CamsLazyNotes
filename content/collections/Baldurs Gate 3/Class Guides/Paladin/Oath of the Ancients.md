## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- In Baldur’s Gate 3, The Oath of Ancients is a Paladin subclass that draws its power and inspiration from the ancient forces of nature, light, and goodness. Paladins who swear this oath become guardians of the natural world and defenders against darkness and corruption.
- This Paladin build with Oath of the Ancient subclass is one that players should pick for extra utility in the group. You can provide some decent healing, get access to crowd-control abilities, and still retain the identity of the Paladin.
- We will be using heavy armor, and two-handed weapons to charge into melee range. This build will provide tons of damage and get better over time, though it can be complex at first to understand.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **A heavily-armored two-hander that saves resources for burst and uses situational healing/utility when needed, while pushing toward extra actions/attacks for big endgame turns.**

### Party role
- Extra utility in the group: decent healing + crowd-control abilities while still retaining the identity of the Paladin.
- Frontline melee: heavy armor + two-handed weapons to charge into melee range for tons of damage over time.

### Pros
- Crowd Control
- High Burst Damage
- Heavy Armour

### Cons
- Spell Slot Starved
- Limited Spells
- Complex

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: Subclass features and more spell slots (Divine Health, Nature’s Wrath, Turn the Faithless, Speak with Animals).
- Level 8: Great Weapon Master (a big boost in power).
- Level 12: Fighter 2 Action Surge (extra action; recharges with Short Rest) + “attack math” turns.

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Zariel Tiefling
- **Class:** Paladin
- **Subclass:** Oath of the Ancients
- **Background:** Soldier
- **Skills:** Athletics and Intimidation
- **Abilities:** STR 16 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 8 / WIS 10 / CHA 10

### Race (Why Zariel Tiefling)
- Zariel Tiefling is the best race for the Best Baldur’s Gate 3 Paladin Oath of Ancients Build Guide because you gain racial spells that aid in damage and utility. You gain Darkvision, fire resistance, and two smites: Searing Smite and Branding Smite.

### Background (Why Soldier)
- Soldier is the best background for the BG3 Paladin Oath of Ancients build because you gain proficiency in Athletics and Intimidation. Intimidation is useful in dialogue situations and Athletics helps you shove, resist shoves, and improves jumping.

## Level-by-level progression (Paladin 1 → 10, Fighter 1 → 2)
> **Rule for this section:** I’m listing what you pick up / select each level, but not re-explaining what each spell does.

### Level 1 — Paladin 1
**Gain**
- Channeled Oath Charges
- Lay on Hands
- Divine Sense
- Healing Radiance
- Oath of the Ancient Tenets (oath you need to maintain; if you break the oath, you can unlock a new subclass, Oathbreaker)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Move along quickly to level 2 for spell unlocks; use Lay on Hands and Healing Radiance for healing and damage comes from the main weapon attack.
- In the early game just rely on weapon damage; your goal is to find some heavy armor and a two-handed weapon.

### Level 2 — Paladin 2
**Gain**
- Divine Smite (configure via Reactions: automatic, crit-only, or popup)
- Prepared spells (5):  
  - Searing Smite  
  - Thunderous Smite  
  - Shield of Faith  
  - Divine Favor  
  - (fifth prepared spell as you prefer from available options)

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Be cautious with Divine Smite early: you will burn through spell slots quickly and need to rest constantly if you overuse it.
- Keep the loop simple: mostly melee weapon attacks, spend spell slots when you need hard single-target damage or a stun.

### Level 3 — Paladin 3 (Oath of the Ancients)
**Gain**
- +1 Level 1 spell slot (total 3)
- +1 prepared spell
- Divine Health
- Subclass actions/spells: Nature’s Wrath, Turn the Faithless, Speak with Animals, Ensnaring Strike (Ranged)
- Prepared spell option highlighted by the guide: Command

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Turn 1: usually buff with Divine Favour or Shield of Faith, then attack in melee.
- Turn 2+: decide on priority: if you need crowd control use Command; if you need to kill a target, spend slots for your best burst.

### Level 4 — Paladin 4
**Gain**
- Feat / ASI choice  
  - Recommended: **Ability Improvement +2 Strength**

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Still spell-slot limited: rely on weapon attacks, use a bonus-action buff first, then spend slots only when you need burst or control.
- Keep it steady: buff → pressure → burst when it matters.

### Level 5 — Paladin 5
**Gain**
- The guide notes this is where slot management becomes a real issue: you need to use Divine Smite reactions appropriately.

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Do not go off wandering into the unknown without your spell slots full.
- Use your spell slots when you need a big damage turn; otherwise keep pressure with primary melee attacks.

### Level 6 — Paladin 6
**Gain**
- +1 prepared spell (total 9)
- Aura of Protection
- Spell highlighted by the guide: Magic Weapon

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Once you unlock Aura of Protection you need to activate it for its effect.
- Gameplay doesn’t change much: manage spell slots and use burst selectively.

### Level 7 — Paladin 7
**Gain**
- +1 Level 2 spell slot
- Aura of Warding
- Spell highlighted by the guide: Lesser Restoration

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Not much changes; you are about to reach level 8 for a big boost in power with a game-changing feat.
- Continue prioritizing burst damage and use utility only when needed.

### Level 8 — Paladin 8
**Gain**
- Feat: **Great Weapon Master**
- (Guide note) This scales further with Potion of Speed or Haste for additional actions/attacks.

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Open with your preferred bonus-action buff, then focus on kills/crit chains to proc Great Weapon Master.
- Spend spell slots for burst when it secures a kill or swings a priority target.

### Level 9 — Paladin 9
**Gain**
- 2 Level 3 Spell Slots
- Spell options highlighted by the guide: Protection from Energy, Plant Growth, Blinding Smite, Elemental Weapon
- Prepared spells note: drop Compelled Duel so you can pick up two level 3 spells.

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Bread and butter remains the same: resource-managed burst + weapon pressure.
- Use utility/control when it saves the party tempo; otherwise keep the plan simple.

### Level 10 — Paladin 10
**Gain**
- +1 Lay on Hands Charge
- Aura of Courage
- +1 spell (guide: take Revivify)
- Prepared spells remain unchanged from here on out (per the guide)

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Gameplay remains unchanged at this level with more utility.
- You’re still primarily a frontline weapon attacker who spends resources for big moments.

### Level 11 — Fighter 1 (Multiclass)
**Gain**
- Defence Fighting Style (+1 AC while wearing armor)
- Second Wind
- (Guide framing) The payoff is Action Surge next level.

**Play style (Level 11)**
- This level will feel uneventful if you multi-class, but the payoff is next level.
- Keep doing what you’ve been doing: heavy armor, two-hander, selective burst.

### Level 12 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- Action Surge (extra action; recharges with Short Rest)
- Action Surge + Extra Attack math (from the guide):
  - Attack one + extra attack = 2  
  - Attack two (via Action Surge) + extra attack = 4  
  - Attack three (via Haste) + extra attack = 6  
  - Great Weapon Master via critical strike or kill = 7 (if you have a bonus action)
- (If staying full Paladin 12 instead) Feat suggestion from the guide: Ability Improvement +2 Strength or Alert.

**Play style (Level 12)**
- This setup is the endgame identity: stack actions to produce remarkable attack power and erase targets.
- Aim your biggest turns into priority targets: Action Surge when it converts into kills (and thus Great Weapon Master procs).

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
(Not specified in source)

---

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- Alternative build (Warlock/Paladin multiclass concept): consider a Warlock/Paladin multiclass build. Just two levels in Hexblade Warlock provide a powerful early-game foundation with strong melee scaling and spellcasting. After reaching level 3, switch to Paladin and choose the Oath of Vengeance subclass for increased mobility and burst damage. By level 5, this combo significantly boosts your melee potential and versatility. To round out the build, take levels in Fighter with the Eldritch Knight subclass, adding even more spellcasting utility and consistent weapon damage.
- Level Class Selection (as listed):
  - 1 Warlock — Hexblade, Shield, Hellish Rebuke, Booming Blade, Eldritch Blast
  - 2 Warlock — Wrathful Smite, Hex spells, One with Shadows, Devil’s Sight Invocations
  - 3 Paladin — Multiclass Paladin, Vengeance Subclass
  - 4 Paladin — Great Weapon Fighting, Command, Thunderous Smite, Divine Favour, Shield of Faith, Cure Wounds
  - 5 Paladin — Protection from Good and Evil
  - 6 Paladin — Great Weapon Master Feat, Compelled Duel
  - 7 Paladin — Drop Compelled, select Magic Weapon, Lesser Restoration
  - 8 Paladin — Aid spell
  - 9 Fighter — Multiclass Fighter, Defense Fighting Style
  - 10 Fighter — Action Surge
  - 11 Fighter — Eldritch Knight subclass, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile spells, Bursting Sinew, Fire Bolt cantrips, Longstrider extended
  - 12 Fighter — Savage Attacker feat, Shield spell
