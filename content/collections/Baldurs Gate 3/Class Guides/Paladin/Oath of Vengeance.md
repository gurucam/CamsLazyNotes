## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- In Baldur’s Gate 3, Oath of Vengeance Paladins are committed to hunting down and punishing the most grievous sinners.
- What makes the Paladin class unique is their Divine Smite ability, which combined with high Charisma and the right equipment, lends them incredible combat power.
- Moreover, the Paladin excels at influencing dialogue and aiding the party in non-combat situations. With the Paladin, you blend the best of both worlds in BG3, great combat performance with utility in dialogue and exploration.
- The downside to the Paladin is limited spell slots and weak mobility at the start. So, expect a slow start, with a complex series of spells. You can safely ignore most spells and just Divine Smite blast every enemy in your way.
- To create the best Paladin build in BG3, we will use the Oath of Vengeance subclass.
- Vengeance has high mobility with access to the Misty Step spell at level 5. This gives it an enormous advantage when the Paladin’s movement is weaker at the start of the game.
- The subclass offers powerful spells at various levels that are always prepared. Consider Vengeance a great subclass for the Paladin if you don’t want to break your Oath.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Stay on priority targets in melee, and convert limited resources into decisive burst turns while keeping a simple “hit first, hit hard” loop.**

### Party role
- **Frontline melee:** heavy armour, two-handed weapon pressure, and absorbs attention.
- **Burst damage:** converts spell slots into radiant damage through Divine Smite for priority target deletion.
- **Utility in and out of combat:** dialogue influence, situational crowd control, and emergency healing.

### Pros
- Crowd Control
- High Burst Damage
- Heavy Armour

### Cons
- Spell Slot Starved
- Limited Spells
- Low Mobility

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: Divine Smite + core spell kit turns on
- Level 3: Vengeance subclass features + Hunter’s Mark/Bane always prepared
- Level 5: Extra Attack + major mobility upgrade
- Level 8: Great Weapon Master (big damage increase)
- Level 9: Haste (huge action economy increase)
- Level 12: Action Surge (extra action once per fight; stacks with Extra Attack + Haste/Speed)

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Half-Orc
- **Class:** Paladin
- **Subclass:** Oath of Vengeance
- **Background:** Soldier
- **Skills:** Persuasion, Insight
- **Abilities (target):** STR 16 / DEX 10 / CON 14 / INT 8 / WIS 10 / CHA 16

### Recommended backgrounds
- Soldier: Proficiency in Athletics and Intimidation. You are trained in battlefield tactics and combat, having served in a militia, mercenary company, or officer corps. Soldier companions in BG3 are Jaheira and Lae’zel.
- Noble: Proficiency in History and Persuasion. You were raised in a family among the social elite, accustomed to power and privilege. A noble companion is Minthara.
- Guild Artisan: Proficiency in Insight and Persuasion. Your skill in a particular craft has earned you membership in a mercantile guild, offering privileges and protection while engaging in your art. No Guild Artisan companions in BG3.

### Best race choice (why Half-Orc)
- The Half-Orc is the best race choice for Oath of Vengeance Paladin build in Baldur’s Gate 3 because the Relentless Endurance racial feature can save you from death. Upon dropping to 0 hit points, instead of getting downed, you stay at 1 HP once per Long Rest.
- The Half-Orc’s Savage Attack allows for extra damage and Darkvision is vital playing in the Underdark.
- A secondary choice is Zariel Tiefling because of fire resistance and two free smite spells, Searing and Branding.

### Best companions for Oath of Vengeance Paladin
- Shadowheart (Cleric): Buffs, healing, and crowd control.
- Gale (Wizard): Range magic damage, area damage, and crowd control.
- Astarion (Rogue): Burst damage, lockpicking, and range if needed.

### Paladin Illithid Powers
Illithid Powers are unlocked past the game’s introduction when you learn more about the Mind Flayers and Tadpoles. You can find jars of Mind Flayer Parasite Specimens, and consume them to gain points to invest in Illithid Powers. This is essentially another skill tree advancement with some very strong abilities. If you decide to advance this skill line, these are the choices we suggest.

## Level-by-level progression (Paladin 1 → 10, Fighter 1 → 2)

### Level 1 — Paladin 1
**Gain**
- Lay on Hands
- Divine Sense
- Inquisitor’s Might
- Channeled Oath Charges
- Oath of Vengeance Tenets: No Mercy for the Wicked.

**Play style (Level 1)**
- In the early game just rely on weapon damage; use Lay on Hands for healing, Inquisitor’s Might for extra damage, and swing your sword.
- Your goal is to find some heavy armor and a two-handed weapon.

### Level 2 — Paladin 2
**Gain**
- Divine Smite
- Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting
- Spells: Searing Smite, Thunderous Smite, Shield of Faith, Divine Favour, Cure Wounds

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Be cautious at first about using Divine Smite too often; you will burn through your spell slots quickly at this low level, and either have to rest or just use melee attacks only.
- In summary, save your spell slots and use them for extra burst damage with a weapon attack/divine smite combo.

### Level 3 — Paladin 3 (Oath of Vengeance)
**Gain**
- Subclass: Vengeance
- Divine Health
- Abjure Enemy
- Vow of Enmity
- Receives Bane
- Receives Hunter’s Mark
- Spell: Command

**Play style (Level 3)**
- The premise here is to use bonus actions and actions effectively per turn: buff turn one, and use burst damage turn two; turn three evaluate what your group needs, crowd control, burst, healing, etc.
- Also, check if you have a bonus action spent before ending your turn. If not, Hunter’s Mark, Divine Favour, or Shield of Faith can be vital if you have spell slots.

### Level 4 — Paladin 4
**Feat**
- Ability improvement rather than +2 to strength (increase strength to 18)

**Gain**
- Spell: Protection from Evil and Good

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Gameplay remains unchanged at this level. Expect more damage and better chances to land an attack.
- Keep leveling to get more spells and more spell slots.

### Level 5 — Paladin 5
**Gain**
- Extra Attack
- Receives Misty Step
- Receives Hold Person
- More spell slots
- Spell: Branding Smite

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Your bread and butter remains the same: weapon attacks plus Smite burst when you need it; now you have Extra Attack so your action is worth more.
- Use your mobility tools to start fights in melee range (or force melee contact fast) so your turn isn’t wasted closing distance.

### Level 6 — Paladin 6
**Gain**
- Aura of Protection
- Spell: Magic Weapon

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Gameplay remains mostly unchanged at this level; you are more effective defensively and can continue to focus on melee burst damage.
- Use utility only when you need it; otherwise keep your loop simple and spend resources where they matter.

### Level 7 — Paladin 7
**Gain**
- Relentless Avenger
- Spell: Lesser Restoration

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Relentless Avenger gives you more movement after opportunity attacks—use positioning to punish enemies that try to disengage.
- Use your healing, crowd control, and utility only when needed and keep pressure with melee attacks.

### Level 8 — Paladin 8
**Feat**
- Great Weapon Master

**Gain**
- Spell: Compelled Duel

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Treat Great Weapon Master as your big damage lever; when you expect a kill/crit, you can snowball a turn.
- Avoid wasting bonus actions; keep your turn clean so you can take follow-ups when you get them.

### Level 9 — Paladin 9
**Gain**
- Receives Haste
- Receives Protection from Energy
- Spells: Blinding Smite, Elemental Weapon

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Your bread and butter remains the same, Smite damage; most of the added spells will be used in niche situations.
- With Blinding Smite you have a hard counter against fellow martial weapon users; keep things simple and use your off-healing, crowd control, and utility only when needed.

### Level 10 — Paladin 10
**Gain**
- Lay on Hands Charge
- Aura of Courage
- Spell: Revivify

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Gameplay remains unchanged at this level with more utility.
- Revivify is typically a long range way to bring someone back; you can throw potions or use help, but this can be useful for long range to bring someone back.

### Level 11 — Fighter 1
**Multiclass**
- Fighter 1

**Gain**
- Defence Fighting Style (+1 AC while wearing armor)
- Second Wind

**Play style (Level 11)**
- This level will feel uneventful, but it sets up Action Surge next; combat loop stays the same and survival improves.
- The guide’s reasoning: the Paladin can benefit from another action once per fight, increasing your damage significantly.

### Level 12 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- Action Surge

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Action Surge is a once-per-fight usage, but it allows you to cast another spell, attack, dash, etc. It gives you that extra oomph that no other class has.
- Burst math from the guide: Attack one + extra attack = 2; Attack two (via Action Surge) + extra attack = 4; Attack three (via Haste) + extra attack = 6; Great Weapon Master via critical strike or kill = 7 (if you have a bonus action).

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- Investing a couple of levels into the Warlock class first will help you get a much stronger start in Act 1 of Baldur’s Gate 3.
- This is because the Hexbalde Warlock starts incredibly strong and gets you the Booming Blade cantrip.
- Then, once you reach level 3, swap to the Paladin and pick up the Vengeance subclass.
- With five levels of investment, you will have much more movement speed and melee potential.
- Finish off with the Fighter and Eldritch Knight subclass for even more spellcasting and melee damage potential.
- Level Class Selection
  - 1 Warlock — Hexblade, Shield, Hellish Rebuke, Booming Blade, Eldritch Blast
  - 2 Warlock — Wrathful Smite, Hex spells, One with Shadows, Devil’s Sight Invocations
