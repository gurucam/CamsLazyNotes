  - Don’t be afraid to use Divine Smite multiple times per turn, especially if you are facing a group of enemies.
- Early priorities and notes:
  - Early phase has dreadful mobility; find and locate a back-bar ranged weapon like a Heavy Crossbow from Lae’zel or others.

    - Sell, stock up, complete quest
    - Unlock Withers, respec companions

  1. Spell Slots: use your spell slots wisely, especially for Divine Smite and Healing
  2. Divine Smite: use this extra damage source on the hardest to defeat enemies and save your spell slots for when you really need it.
  3. Healing: use potions that consume bonus actions or Lay on Hands for yourself or an ally.
  4. Heavy Armor: find and equip this early for needed AC.
  5. Crowd Control: make sure to CC enemies with Thunderous Smite or a Companion ability to limit damage.
  6. Pre-Buff: have a companion cast blessed prior to combat to get a roll Advantage.
  7. Range: don’t forget to equip a ranged weapon to ensure you can do damage on nearly every turn.
  8. Long Rest: use the rest at camp function to regain spell slots and don’t go into a fight with zero.
  9. Great Weapon Master: focus on low-health targets with your first action to strike a kill and another attack with Great Weapon Master.

- Released Patch 7 for Baldur’s Gate 3 on September 5th, 2024; added many new features.
