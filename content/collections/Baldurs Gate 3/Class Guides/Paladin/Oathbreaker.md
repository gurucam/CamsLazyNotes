## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- A Paladin “birthed from ‘bad’ moral decisions,” representing a descent into darkness and corruption.
- Plays like an antihero or a fallen Paladin seeking redemption, straying from their oath in a morally grey way.

### Core Playstyle
- Charge into melee with a two-handed weapon and use spell slots wisely to fuel burst damage while mixing in crowd control and undead utility when needed.

### Party Role
- Frontline melee juggernaut focused on high damage.
- Crowd control option through area-based fear and control tools.
- Undead/fiend synergy through aura bonuses and undead control/summons.

### Pros
- Crowd Control
- High Burst Damage
- Heavy Armour

### Cons
