## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
A fallen Paladin who leans into aggression and intimidation: heavy armour, a two-hander, brutal Smites, fear effects, and even commanding undead.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- You’re a front-line juggernaut who walks into melee, picks the most dangerous target, and ends it with heavy weapon hits backed by limited but high-impact resources.

### Party role
- Front-line bruiser / burst damage
- Crowd control (fear, prone, command)
- Utility support (auras, emergency healing)

### Pros
- Crowd Control
- High Burst Damage
- Heavy Armour

### Cons
- Spell Slot Starved
- Limited Mobility
- Complex

### Power spikes to look forward to
- **Level 2**: Prepared Spells + **Divine Smite**
- **Level 5**: **Extra Attack** + more spell slots
- **Level 7**: **Aura of Hate**
- **Level 8**: **Great Weapon Master**
- **Level 12**: **Action Surge**

## Character creation

### Racial notes (why Half-Orc)
Half-Orc is recommended because **Relentless Endurance** can save you from death once per Long Rest, **Savage Attacks** boosts melee damage, and **Darkvision** helps in the Underdark. A secondary choice is **Zariel Tiefling** for Fire Resistance and free Smite spells.

### Starting setup
- **Character Origin** — Custom character
- **Race** — Half-Orc
- **Class** — Paladin
- **Subclass** — Vengeance (Oathbreaker at level 2)
- **Background** — Soldier
- **Skill Proficiencies** — Persuasion and Insight
- **Starting Spells** — Searing Smite, Thunderous Smite, Shield of Faith, Divine Favor, Cure Wounds
- **Ability Scores**
  - STR: 16
  - DEX: 10
  - CON: 14
  - INT: 8
  - WIS: 10
  - CHA: 16

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
Equip a **Two-Handed Greatsword**, keep a ranged weapon for turns you can’t reach melee, and look to acquire **Elixir of Bloodlust** or **Potion of Invisibility** while progressing.

Your overall priority with the build is:
- Complete Prologue
- Recruit Other Companions
- Reach Druid Grove
- Sell, Stock up, complete quests
- Unlock Withers, respec to proper ability score
- Progress to level 5
- Reach Underdark and Grymforge

## Level-by-level progression (Paladin 1 → 10, Fighter 1 → 2)

### Level 1 — Paladin 1
**Gain**
- Lay on Hands
- Divine Sense

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Close to melee and start trading; you’ll feel much sturdier once you pick up heavy armour upgrades.
- Keep a ranged weapon equipped for the “I can’t reach anything this turn” moments.

### Level 2 — Paladin 2
**Gain**
- Break Oath to unlock subclass (Oathbreaker)
- Great Weapon Fighting style
- Divine Smite
- Prepared Spells: Searing Smite, Thunderous Smite, Shield of Faith, Divine Favor, Cure Wounds

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Hit things and choose when to spend spell slots on **Divine Smite**—save it for the hardest target or a clean kill.
- Be selective with Thunderous/Searing Smite; it’s easy to burn multiple resources on a target that didn’t deserve it.

### Level 3 — Paladin 3
**Gain**
- +1 Level 1 spell slot (to 3)
- Divine Health
- +1 prepared spell
- Subclass: Hellish Rebuke, Inflict Wounds, Dreadful Aspect, Control Undead
- Prepared Spell recommendation: Command

**Play style (Level 3)**
- You will be **spell slot starved**—set **Divine Smite** to “Ask” so you can control slot usage.
- Use **Control Undead** when possible and let your summon add pressure while you focus on Smite targets.

### Level 4 — Paladin 4
**Gain**
- Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Strength, to 18)
- Prepared Spell recommendation: Protection from Evil and Good

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Your loop is still straightforward: two-handed attacks first, Smite only when it swings the fight.
- Keep Protection from Evil and Good as a flex for fights where getting controlled on turn one would ruin you.

### Level 5 — Paladin 5
**Gain**
- Extra Attack
- Level 1 + Level 2 spell slots unlocked
- +1 prepared spell (take Protection from Poison)
- Subclass spells: Branding Smite, Crown of Madness, Darkness

**Play style (Level 5)**
- With **Extra Attack**, you get to “fish” for a good hit before committing a Smite—your burst becomes more consistent.
- **Branding Smite** is a strong answer to enemies that try to go Invisible later; save it for targets you can’t afford to lose.

### Level 6 — Paladin 6
**Gain**
- Aura of Protection (must be activated in passives)
- Prepared Spell: Magic Weapon

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Keep **Aura of Protection** active; it’s one of the best passive power boosts you get.
- Use **Magic Weapon** as a pre-fight buff when you can afford the slot and Concentration.

### Level 7 — Paladin 7
**Gain**
- +1 Level 2 spell slot
- Subclass feature: Aura of Hate
- Prepared Spell: Lesser Restoration

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Turn on **Aura of Hate** and keep it active—free damage scaling, especially once you’re running undead.
- Lesser Restoration is niche, but it’s clutch when paralysis/poison/blind shuts someone down.

### Level 8 — Paladin 8
**Gain**
- Feat: Great Weapon Master

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Toggle Great Weapon Master’s -5/+10 as needed; don’t sabotage your hit chance when you need reliability.
- Try to secure a kill early in the turn so you can chain into the bonus-action attack.

### Level 9 — Paladin 9
**Gain**
- 2 Level 3 spell slots
- Subclass spells: Bestow Curse, Animate Dead
- Spell selection: Blinding Smite, Elemental Weapon
- Note: drop Compelled Duel so you can pick up two level 3 spells

**Play style (Level 9)**
- **Blinding Smite** is your big burst + debuff swing—use it on dangerous martial threats.
- **Animate Dead** is best used outside combat; spending a slot for an extra body is often worth it.

### Level 10 — Paladin 10
**Gain**
- Lay on Hands Charge
- Aura of Courage
- Prepared Spell: Revivify

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Aura of Courage keeps your team from getting shut down by fear effects.
- Revivify is a safety net—still win fights by staying proactive with burst and positioning.

### Level 11 — Fighter 1
**Gain**
- Defence Fighting Style (+1 AC while wearing armour)
- Second Wind

**Play style (Level 11)**
- The +1 AC is real durability, and Second Wind is a bonus-action top-up when you can’t spare a potion.
- You’re here for the next level—keep pushing.

### Level 12 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- Action Surge

**Play style (Level 12)**
- **Action Surge** turns one turn into a blender: Attack → Action Surge → Attack again (and still Smite when it matters).
- Pair it with Potion of Speed/Haste if you want the most ridiculous “delete” turns.

  - Turn a successful hit into a **Critical Hit**; perfect for a “this target must die” Smite moment.
- **Psionic Backlash**
  - Reaction Psychic damage when an enemy within **9m** casts a spell; value vs casters without spending slots.
- **Ability Drain**
  - Once per turn on Attack Roll, reduce target’s corresponding Ability by 1; passive debuff with no action cost.
- **Repulsor**
  - Massive area knockback (can hit friendlies); emergency tool to reset space when you’re getting swarmed.

---

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
If you’re aiming for a stronger start in Act 1, the Warlock/Paladin multiclass combo is a top-tier choice. Just two levels in Hexblade Warlock offer an early-game power spike, granting you potent melee scaling and spellcasting tools. After hitting level 3, transition into Paladin and choose the Oath of Vengeance subclass for enhanced mobility and high single-target burst. With five total levels invested, you’ll enjoy excellent melee potential and movement options. To cap off the build, consider taking levels in Fighter with the Eldritch Knight subclass, adding even more spellcasting versatility and sustained weapon damage to your arsenal.
