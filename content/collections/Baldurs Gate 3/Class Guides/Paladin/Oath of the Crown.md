## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- A “true tank” Paladin playstyle built around drawing aggro with an AoE taunt in a 9-meter radius.
- A novel Paladin setup that can dish out damage and avoid it by forcing enemies to attack you while they constantly miss.
- A hybrid Paladin + Shadow Sorcerer multiclass that leans into survivability, group support, and utility.

### Core Playstyle
- Taunt enemies to attack only you, then fight from inside a cloud of magical darkness/blindness you can see through so enemies struggle to hit you while you keep dealing damage.

### Party Role
- Tank: draw attacks away from allies with taunts and “attack only you” effects.
- Group support: healing and buffs early (especially Act 1) while still retaining Paladin damage.
- Control/utility: use defensive reactions and spell utility to shut down threats and protect allies.

### Pros
- High Survivability
- Group Utility
- Decent Damage

### Cons
- Slow start
- Low Mobility
- Vulnerable to Stuns

### Power Spikes
- Level 5: Extra Attack; unlocks level 2 spell slots and Always Prepared subclass spells.
- Level 6: Aura of Protection; “your power dramatically increases.”
- Level 7: Multiclass into Shadow Magic Sorcerer for more damage and utility.
- Level 9: Core combo comes online (move inside magical darkness you can see through, taunt enemies, and avoid almost all damage).

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Use the Eyes of Darkness spell from the Sorcerer to create a cloud of blindness, then taunt enemies for them to attack you.
- Alternatively, use the Act 2 Eversight Ring found in House of Healing Morgue X: 9 Y: -981 to prevent almost all incoming damage towards you, while protecting and allowing you to tank for your allies.
- Loot Everything: You will need a lot of gold to buy consumables, potions, and ammunition so loot and sell constantly.
- Crafting: Elixirs and potions are vital, and you need to purchase materials when trading for crafting.
- Reach Level 6: Spend the early part of the game completing every quest to reach level 6 where your power dramatically increases.
- Sell Often: Your carrying capacity will be limited so sell often, and store excessive items in your traveler’s chest.
- Stealth: Start combat in stealth if at all possible to trigger the Surprise status effect.
- Consider Illithid Powers: While it can come with an altered appearance, the powers are powerful and can help you.
- Oils + Elixiris: Combine both oils/coatings and Elixir during combat for a dual benefit.
- Persuasion: Try to avoid combat through dialogue if possible.
- Best tip: obtain the Act 1 tank gear combination: Amulet of Restoration, the Whispering Promise, Hellrider’s Pride, and Boots of Aid and Comfort.
  - Amulet of Restoration grants the use of the Mass healing word, a bonus action spell that heals everyone within 18 meters.
  - When healed each character will gain Bless Spell, Resistance Cantrip, and extra health.

## Alternative Build Route
- For players preferring a stronger DPS alternative, use the Warlock and Paladin multiclass combo.
- This helps because the Hexblade Warlock starts incredibly strong with just two levels of investment.
- Once you reach level 3, swap to the Paladin and pick up the Vengeance subclass.
- With five levels of investment, you will have much more movement speed and melee potential.
- Finish off with the Fighter and Eldritch Knight subclass for even more spellcasting and melee damage potential.

Level plan (Alternative):
- Level 1: Warlock — Hexblade, Shield, Hellish Rebuke, Booming Blade, Eldritch Blast
- Level 2: Warlock — Wrathful Smite, Hex spells, One with Shadows, Devil’s Sight Invocations
- Level 3: Paladin — Multiclass Paladin, Vengeance Subclass
- Level 4: Paladin — Great Weapon Fighting, Command, Thunderous Smite, Divine Favour, Shield of Faith, Cure Wounds
- Level 5: Paladin — Protection from Good and Evil

- Level 11: Fighter — Eldritch Knight subclass, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile spells, Bursting Sinew, Fire Bolt cantrips, Longstrider extended
- Level 12: Fighter — Savage Attacker feat, Shield spell

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- Larian Studios released 12 new subclasses for Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 8, one for each class; Paladin’s latest subclass is Oath of the Crown.
- Oath of the Crown is hailed as the first true tank in the game, with an AoE taunt spell to draw aggro.
- Booming Blade now offers a notable advantage by adding thunder damage to each attack, making it a strong option (especially when multiclassing into Hexblade Warlock, Sorcerer, or Wizard, or by selecting it with the High Elf’s bonus cantrip).
- Gold Dwarf is described as the top pick for a pure tank build; Half-Orc is recommended if you want to use the alternative build for a more damage-focused playstyle.
- This build page has been updated for the Patch 8 version of Baldur’s Gate 3.
