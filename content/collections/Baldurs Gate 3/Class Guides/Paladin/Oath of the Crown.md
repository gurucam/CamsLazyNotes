## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **frontline tank-paladin** that **taunts in an AoE**, protects allies with auras/reactions, and still delivers big melee bursts with **Divine Smite**.
- The “signature” plan is to **force enemies to focus you**, then make yourself extremely hard to hit using **magical darkness** you can see through (via Shadow Magic).
- Your turns alternate between **locking enemies to you** (taunt/duel) and **staying alive while your party cleans up**.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Taunt a cluster of enemies → stand inside an obscuring cloud you can see through → smite priority targets while they whiff into your defenses.**

### Party role
- **Primary tank:** pulls aggro with Champion Challenge / Compelled Duel and keeps the party stable.
- **Bodyguard:** Aura of Protection + Divine Allegiance to reduce the chance allies get blown up.
- **Melee burst:** converts spare spell slots into damage after hits (Divine Smite).

### Pros
- Real **group tanking** tools (AoE taunt + defensive aura + damage redirection)
- Strong Act 1 support package (bonus-action party heal into multiple buffs via key items)
- Scales into Act 2/3 with “near untouchable” positioning tech in darkness

### Cons
- **Low mobility** and low Dexterity (often later in initiative without help)
- **Vulnerable to stuns** and other “no-actions” effects if you can’t maintain your plan
- Can feel slow early if you don’t lean on gear, potions, and the taunt kit

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Champion Challenge** (AoE taunt) + **Turn the Tide** (AoE healing)
- Level 5: **Extra Attack** + Level 2 spell slots (more uptime and more smites)
- Level 6: **Aura of Protection** (party-wide saving throw spike)
- Level 7–9: Shadow Sorcerer multiclass → **Eyes of the Dark: Darkness** + **metamagic**
- Level 12: **Twinned Haste** + Shadow Sorcerer feature for endgame control/tempo

---

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Gold Dwarf
- **Class:** Paladin
- **Subclass:** Oath of the Crown
- **Background:** Soldier
- **Skills:** Persuasion, Insight
- **Abilities (target):** STR 14 / DEX 10 / CON 17 / INT 8 / WIS 8 / CHA 16
- **Saving throws:** Wisdom, Charisma
- **Armour proficiency:** Light, Medium, Heavy Armour, Shields
- **Weapon proficiency:** Simple and Martial Weapons

### Race notes (why Gold Dwarf)
- The build leans into “true tank” value: **+1 HP per level** keeps your floor high for the entire campaign.
- **Secondary options mentioned in the guide:**
  - **Half-Orc** (Relentless Endurance + Savage Attacks) if you want a more damage-oriented angle.
  - **High Half-Elf** for a free cantrip pick-up (Booming Blade is highlighted as valuable in Patch 8).

### Early-game priorities (from the guide’s framing)
- Play like a tank from the start: heavy armour + shield, and spend resources to keep the team alive.
- Prioritize reaching **Level 6** (Aura of Protection is a major breakpoint).
- In Act 1, assemble the “healing-buff” package (listed in gear) so you can turn a bonus action into multiple party-wide buffs.

## Level-by-level progression (Paladin 1 → 6, Sorcerer 1 → 6)
> This build’s identity is “taunt + survive,” then “taunt + survive inside darkness,” while spending spare slots on smites.

### Level 1 — Paladin 1 (Oath of the Crown)
**Gain**
- **Channeled Oath Charges**
- **Lay on Hands**
- **Divine Sense**
- **Inquisitor’s Might**
- **Righteous Clarity**
- **Oath of the Crown Tenets** (Law, Loyalty, Responsibility)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Start fights in front: pull melee threats toward you and use Lay on Hands as needed to keep tempo.
- Save resources; your “real” combat loop opens up once you have taunt tools and more spell access.

### Level 2 — Paladin 2
**Gain**
- **Fighting Style: Protection**
- **Divine Smite**
- **Spells (prepared/selected):** Command, Compelled Duel, Thunderous Smite, Shield, Cure Wounds

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Use taunt-like pressure early with **Compelled Duel**, and use **Shield** reactively when you’re about to take a hit.
- Spend spell slots on **Divine Smite** primarily after you connect in melee (burst down the most dangerous target).

### Level 3 — Paladin 3 (Crown features come online)
**Gain**
- **Divine Health**
- **Spell selection:** Protection From Good and Evil
- **Subclass features:** Champion Challenge, Turn the Tide
- **Oath spells (Always Prepared):** Command, Compelled Duel

**Play style (Level 3)**
- This is the “tank switch”: **Champion Challenge** to pull a pack onto you, and **Compelled Duel** to lock a single high-DPS threat.
- Use **Turn the Tide** when your team needs a reset (stabilize multiple allies at once).

### Level 4 — Paladin 4
**Gain**
- **Feat: Tough**
- **Spell selection:** Divine Favour

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Tough is pure durability; it makes your taunt plan safer and increases the value of any healing you receive.
- Start hunting the Act 1 support items (Whispering Promise, Amulet of Restoration, Hellrider’s Pride) to power your “bonus-action heal → buffs” loop.

### Level 5 — Paladin 5
**Gain**
- **Extra Attack**
- **Level 2 spell slots**
- **Spell selection:** Aid
- **Spell swap noted in the guide:** take **Magic Weapon** and **drop Divine Favour**
- **Oath spells (Always Prepared):** Warding Bond, Spiritual Weapon

**Play style (Level 5)**
- You now have real threat: **taunt → attack twice**, and smite when you need to delete something quickly.
- Use **Spiritual Weapon** as a distraction body and **Aid** before hard fights for more team HP.

### Level 6 — Paladin 6
**Gain**
- **Aura of Protection**
- **Spell selection:** Protection from Poison

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Keep **Aura of Protection** active whenever you expect saves (this is the “party suddenly stops failing saves” breakpoint).
- Your job is to stay close enough to allies to share the aura, but still be the first point of contact for enemies.

### Level 7 — Sorcerer 1 (Shadow Magic)
**Gain**
- **Subclass: Shadow Magic**
- **Eyes of the Dark**
- **Strength of the Grave**
- **Cantrips:** Booming Blade, Fire Bolt, Friends, Light
- **Spells:** Shield, Chromatic Orb

**Play style (Level 7)**
- You now have “tank utility” options from Sorcerer while keeping the Paladin core: position to protect, then spend slots to smite when needed.
- Use your new spells to cover gaps (ranged pressure, defensive reactions, and flexible damage types).

### Level 8 — Sorcerer 2
**Gain**
- **Sorcery Points**
- **Metamagic:** Twinned Spell, Extended Spell
- **Spell:** Fog Cloud

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Start thinking in “turn shaping”: extend key effects and use Twinned Spell to multiply value on single-target casting.
- Fog Cloud is the early “obscure the field” tool while you set up the later darkness package.

### Level 9 — Sorcerer 3
**Gain**
- **Metamagic:** Quickened Spell
- **Spell:** Shadow Blade
- **Subclass spells/notes:** Darkness (at will as a level 2 spell), Eyes of the Dark: Darkness (you can see through it)

**Play style (Level 9)**
- The core combo appears: **Quickened** your darkness effect, move inside it, then **taunt** so enemies are forced to attack you while blinded.
- Use Shadow Blade as a main-hand option when you want Psychic damage scaling with your overall melee plan.

### Level 10 — Sorcerer 4
**Gain**
- **Feat: Alert**
- **Spell:** Mirror Image
- **Cantrip:** Mage Hand

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Alert solves your “late turn” problem; act earlier and establish the taunt/darkness plan before enemies spread out.
- Pre-buff **Mirror Image** for extremely hard fights, then stand inside your obscuring cloud and hold aggro.

### Level 11 — Sorcerer 5
**Gain**
- **Spell:** Fireball
- **Spell swap noted in the guide:** replace **Fog Cloud** with **Counterspell**

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Fireball gives you a real AoE answer when fights aren’t solved by single-target taunt.
- Counterspell is your “stop the thing that breaks the plan” tool (enemy casters and ranged control).

### Level 12 — Sorcerer 6
**Gain**
- **Spell:** Haste (noted as Twinnable)
- **Subclass feature:** Hound of Ill Omen (summons Nimbus)

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Haste is a major tempo tool: more actions, more pressure, and more ability to maintain control of enemy attention.
- Drop the hound into fights where you need extra bodies and disruption while you keep enemies locked to you.
