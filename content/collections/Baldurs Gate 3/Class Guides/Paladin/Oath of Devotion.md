## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- The Oath of Devotion is a Paladin subclass that embodies an unwavering commitment to ideals of honor, justice, and duty.
- From a gameplay perspective, this BG3 Oath of Devotion Paladin build will focus on prototypical gameplay. Primary features include heavy armor and two-handed melee weapons with extra utility, healing, and buffs.
- The subclass improves upon raw damage with flashy Divine Smite spells while contributing to the team with extra healing and buffs.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Charge into melee in Heavy Armour with a two-handed Greatsword, spend spell slots aggressively on Smites to delete priority targets, and use your Oath tools for team protection and control when needed.**

### Party role
- **Frontline striker:** heavy armor, two-handed melee, and high single-target burst when you spend spell slots.
- **Support-capable bruiser:** extra healing and buffs alongside damage.
- **Anti-caster / control utility:** Oath spells like Silence and tools like Thunderous Smite/CC help manage enemy turns.

### Pros
- Crowd Control
- High Burst Damage
- Heavy Armour

### Cons
- Spell Slot Starved
- Limited Spells
- Complex

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: Oath features come online (Sacred Weapon, Turn the Unholy) plus more utility spells.
- Level 5: Extra Attack + more spell slots + Oath spells (Lesser Restoration, Silence).
- Level 8: Great Weapon Master feat.
- Level 12: Action Surge (via Fighter 2).

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Half-Orc
- **Class:** Paladin
- **Subclass:** Oath of Devotion
- **Background:** Noble
- **Skills:** Persuasion, Insight
- **Abilities (target):** STR 16 / DEX 10 / CON 14 / INT 8 / WIS 10 / CHA 16
- **Recommended starting spells:** Searing Smite, Thunderous Smite, Shield of Faith, Divine Favor, Cure Wounds

### Racial notes (why Half-Orc)
- Relentless Endurance, Darkvision, Savage Attack.
- The Half-Orc is the best race choice for an Oath of Devotion Paladin because Relentless Endurance can save you from death (stay at 1 HP for a turn once per Long Rest), Savage Attack allows for extra damage, and Darkvision is vital in the Underdark.

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* Zariel Tiefling (Fire Resistance + free smites: Searing and Branding Smite).

### Recommended backgrounds
- Noble (best), Guild Artisan, Charlatan.

### Best companions (from the guide)
- Shadowheart (Cleric): Buffs, healing, and crowd control.
- Gale (Wizard): Ranged magic damage, area damage, and crowd control.
- Astarion (Rogue): Burst damage, lockpicking, and range if needed.
- You can go more range with Wyll or a double melee setup with Lae’zel; feel free to swap out and explore different options.

### Early combat reminders (from the guide)
- Don’t be afraid to use Divine Smite multiple times per turn, especially if you are facing a group of enemies.
- Save your spell slots for Divine Smite unless needing a buff, heal, or crowd control.
- Toggle Divine Smite on/off in Reactions so you don’t waste spell slots on weak targets.

## Level-by-level progression (Paladin 1 → 10, Fighter 1 → 2)
> This build is resource-driven. Spell slots are your damage budget: spend them on the hardest targets, then long rest to refill.

### Level 1 — Paladin 1
**Gain**
- Lay on Hands
- Divine Sense

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Wear Heavy Armour early if you can find it; use Lay on Hands to stabilize yourself or an ally without burning spell slots.
- Stay in melee with a two-hander and focus one target down at a time.

### Level 2 — Paladin 2
**Gain**
- Divine Smite
- Great Weapon Fighting (Fighting Style)
- Searing Smite
- Thunderous Smite
- Shield of Faith
- Divine Favor
- Cure Wounds

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Start converting spell slots into burst with Divine Smite on priority enemies.
- Use Shield of Faith / Divine Favor when you need a longer fight plan, but remember you’re spell-slot starved.

### Level 3 — Paladin 3 (Oath of Devotion)
**Gain**
- Sacred Weapon
- Protection from Evil and Good
- Sanctuary
- Turn the Unholy
- Command

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Use Sacred Weapon when you need higher hit chance; use Command to force a swing in tempo (drop weapon / approach / etc.).
- Sanctuary and Protection from Evil and Good are your “save someone now” buttons when fights get messy.

### Level 4 — Paladin 4
**Gain**
- Feat: Ability Improvement Strength
- Blessed (recommended additional spell to slot)

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Gameplay remains unchanged at this level. Expect more damage and better chances to land an attack. Keep leveling to get more spells and more spell slots.
- Blessed is useful, but you can consider this a flex skill because you have so many concentration spells and you can only have one active.

### Level 5 — Paladin 5
**Gain**
- Level 1 Spell Slot Unlocked
- Level 2 Spell Slot Unlocked
- 1 Extra Prepared Spell (take Branding Smite & Magic Weapon, drop Blessed)
- Extra Attack
- Subclass spells: Lesser Restoration, Silence
- Magic Weapon
- Branding Smite

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Extra Attack is your main power spike: two attacks in one action with a chance to proc Divine Smite on each.
- Combo Extra Attack with Potion of Speed or the Haste spell for two actions per turn; use Silence to shut down casters and force them to move out of the area.

### Level 6 — Paladin 6
**Gain**
- Aura of Protection
- Protection from Poison

**Play style (Level 6)**
- The level 6 Oath of Devotion Paladin unlocks the following in Baldur’s Gate 3: Aura of Protection and Protection from Poison.
- Gameplay: This is a decent defensive boost with the aura. Keep using Divine Smite to keep damage high and use Healing as a way to help sustain on longer fights.

### Level 7 — Paladin 7
**Gain**
- Aura of Devotion
- Compelled Duel

**Play style (Level 7)**
- The level 7 Oath of Devotion Paladin unlocks: Aura of Devotion and Compelled Duel.
- Gameplay: This level has a slight boost in defense as you can’t be charmed. Use Compelled Duel to force a tough enemy to attack you and not your allies. Otherwise, keep melee smiting.

### Level 8 — Paladin 8
**Gain**
- Feat: Great Weapon Master
- Aid

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Great Weapon Master gives a huge boost to damage but comes at the cost of accuracy. Try to proc a kill first on a low health enemy and use your bonus action as another attack. Use Sacred Weapon and Shield of Faith to increase your chance to hit or increase your AC.
- Aid provides additional hit points, and can be pre-buffed before combat. This is especially helpful in Honor Mode and Tactician.

### Level 9 — Paladin 9
**Gain**
- Remove Curse
- Beacon of Hope
- Blinding Smite
- Elemental Weapon
- Revivify

**Play style (Level 9)**
- More spell slots and stronger options: keep saving most slots for Divine Smite unless you need Beacon of Hope / Revivify to stabilize a fight.
- Use Blinding Smite when you need control value while still hitting hard.

### Level 10 — Paladin 10
**Gain**
- Aura of Courage
- Warden of Vitality

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Defensive aura grows: use your auras to keep the team stable while you remain the frontliner.
- Warden of Vitality gives you more sustain tools for longer encounters, but keep your main damage plan centered on Smite turns.

### Level 11 — Fighter 1
**Multiclass**
- Fighter 1

**Gain**
- Defence (Fighting Style)
- Second Wind

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Combat loop stays the same: you’re setting up Action Surge next level.
- Second Wind is a simple bonus-action heal to keep you upright when you don’t want to spend Paladin resources.

### Level 12 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- Action Surge

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Use Action Surge to frontload damage when it matters most (boss turns, high priority enemies).
- Plan your burst turns around Extra Attack + Divine Smite triggers; Action Surge multiplies how many hits you can convert into burst.

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- For players looking for a better Act 1 start, use the Warlock and Paladin multiclass combo.
- This helps because the Hexblade Warlock starts incredibly strong with just two levels of investment.
- Once you reach level 3, swap to the Paladin and pickup the Vengeance subclass.
- With five levels of investment, you will have much more movement speed and melee potential.
- Finish off with the Fighter and Eldritch Knight subclass for even more spellcasting and melee damage potential.
