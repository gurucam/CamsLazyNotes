## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Early levels mobility:
  - In the early levels of BG3, the Oath of Devotion Paladin will have dreadful mobility.
  - Find and locate a back-bar ranged weapon (example given: a Heavy Crossbow from Lae’zel or traders) so you can do upfront damage before you close the distance.
  - At level 5, look for Misty Step scrolls for mobility at the cost of a bonus action.
- Early consumables priority (as stated):
  - Look to acquire Elixir of Hill Giant Strength, Potion of Speed, and Oil of Accuracy; these three consumables “stack”.
- Overall build priority list (as stated):
  - Complete Prologue
  - Recruit Companions
  - Unlock Withers, respec companions to proper class/ability score
  - Collect the Necromancy of Thay (important in Act 3)
  - Reach Druid Grove
  - Sell, Stock up, complete quests
  - Unlock summons, Scratch, Shovel
  - Progress to level 5
  - Reach Underdark and Grymforge
  - Check all Permanent Bonuses in Act 1 and the best Gear
- Combat tips (10 tips listed in the guide):
  1. Spell Slots: use your spell slots wisely, especially for Divine Smite and Healing
  2. Divine Smite: use this extra damage source on the hardest to defeat enemies and save your spell slots for when you really need it.
  3. Healing: Use potions that consume bonus actions or Lay on Hands for yourself or an ally.
  4. Heavy Armor: Find and equip this early for needed AC.
  5. Crowd Control: Make sure to CC enemies with Thunderous Smite or a Companion ability to limit damage.
  6. Pre-Buff: Cast blessed prior to combat to get a roll Advantage.
  7. Range: Don’t forget to equip a ranged weapon to ensure you can do damage on nearly every turn.
  8. Long Rest: Use the rest at camp function to regain spell slots and don’t go into a fight with zero.
  9. Great Weapon Master: focus on low-health targets with your first action to strike a kill and another attack with Great Weapon Master.
  10. Toggle Reactions: make sure both Divine Smite and Great Weapon Master are toggled on or off when you need them.

## Alternative Build Route
For players looking for a better Act 1 start, use the Warlock and Paladin multiclass combo. This helps because the Hexblade Warlock starts incredibly strong with just two levels of investment. Once you reach level 3, swap to the Paladin and pickup the Vengeance subclass. With five levels of investment, you will have much more movement speed and melee potential. Finish off with the Fighter and Eldritch Knight subclass for even more spellcasting and melee damage potential.

- Level 2: Warlock — Wrathful Smite, Hex spells, One with Shadows, Devil’s Sight Invocations

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- The biggest changes to the Oath of Devotion Paladin build come from the addition of new subclasses, spells, and cantrips.
- While three enemies have been buffed in Tactician and Honour modes, the overall flow of combat remains largely the same.
- Booming Blade now offers a notable advantage by adding thunder damage to each attack, making it a strong option (especially when multiclassing into Hexblade Warlock, Sorcerer, or Wizard, or by selecting it with the High Elf’s bonus cantrip).
- Half-Orc remains the top pick for pure melee damage; Booming Blade adds versatility and burst potential to hybrid builds.
