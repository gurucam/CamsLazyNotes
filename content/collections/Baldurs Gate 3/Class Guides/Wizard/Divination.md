## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **high-control, high-burst Wizard** that manipulates outcomes with Divination tricks, then deletes priority targets with heavy spellcasting.
- Plays like “**pick the moment, force it to go your way, and end the fight early**”—you open strong with control, then scale into massive AoE and elite-killing single-target turns.
- Cloth-and-positioning gameplay: you stay at range, use smart angles, and lean on mobility + reactions to survive while you cast.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Stay at range, control enemy turns with smart positioning and reactions, then spend your biggest resources early to remove the most dangerous targets before they act.**

### Party role
- **Backline DPS:** reliable damage that scales hard with spell levels.
- **Crowd control / fight “director”:** remove enemy turns and create safe openings for your melee.
- **Clutch utility:** repositioning, defensive reactions, and “problem solver” tools for tough encounters.

### Pros
- Very strong **AoE damage** and excellent scaling into late game
- Lots of **control** and “answer buttons” for dangerous enemies
- Plays well with a traditional party (tank + healer + melee DPS)

### Cons
- Spell slots can run dry quickly if you don’t rest often
- Positioning mistakes are punishing (cloth defenses)
- Friendly-fire risk with big area spells if you’re careless with targeting

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Portent** (Divination identity turns on)
- Level 5: **Fireball + Counterspell** (major combat swing)
- Level 6: **Haste** (huge tempo increase)
- Level 9: **Cone of Cold** (late-mid AoE spike)
- Level 11: **Disintegrate** (elite deletion turns)
- Level 12: **+2 Intelligence** (stronger casting + more prepared spells)

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** High Half-Elf
- **Class:** Wizard
- **Subclass:** Divination School
- **Background:** Sage
- **Skills:** Investigation, Religion
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 14 / INT 16 / WIS 10 / CHA 10

### Skills (what to take)
- **Investigation**
- **Religion**

### Ability score notes
- **Intelligence 16** is the priority (spells land more often and hit harder).
- **Dexterity 16** + cloth + Mage Armour is your early survival plan (16 AC baseline with the recommended setup).
- **Constitution 14** supports concentration and survivability.

### Best companions (party suggestions)
- **Lae’zel (Fighter):** frontline pressure, control, and draws aggression.
- **Shadowheart (Cleric):** buffs, healing, and control.
- **Astarion (Rogue):** ranged damage, sneak attacks, trap utility.
- General party idea: one tank, one healer, one melee DPS, and one ranged DPS (you).

## Level-by-level progression (Wizard 1 → 12)
> This build is very “turn-plan” driven. Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop.

### Level 1 — Wizard 1
**Gain**
- Cantrips: **Fire Bolt**, **Light**, **Mage Hand**, **Blade Ward**
- Spells: **Mage Armour**, **Magic Missile**, **Sleep**, **Thunderwave**, **Chromatic Orb**, **Shield**

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Pre-cast **Mage Armour** after long rests, then play fights from max range and use terrain to keep enemies walking.
- Spend slots early to prevent enemy turns (Sleep) or stabilize (Shield), and don’t be afraid to rest when you’ve emptied your big tools.

### Level 2 — Wizard 2 (Divination)
**Subclass**
- **Divination**
- **Portent**

**Gain**
- Spells: **Grease**, **Find Familiar**
- **Portent** (subclass feature)

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Start thinking in “setup turns”: slow/control space first (Grease), then punish clustered enemies next turn.
- Use Portent to force your best moments (key control lands, enemy misses, or your big damage connects) and treat it like a fight-winning resource.

### Level 3 — Wizard 3
**Gain**
- Spells: **Scorching Ray**, **Misty Step**

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Your turns get smoother: **Misty Step** is your panic button for distance, high ground, or escaping melee.
- Use **Scorching Ray** when you need reliable single-target pressure; otherwise keep leaning on control first, damage second.

### Level 4 — Wizard 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Intelligence**

**Gain**
- Cantrip: **Minor Illusion**
- Spells: **Flaming Sphere**, **Mirror Image**

**Play style (Level 4)**
- You’re sturdier and more consistent: use **Mirror Image** when you expect to take heat, then keep casting safely.
- Use **Minor Illusion** to manipulate enemy positioning and set up cleaner AoE turns.

### Level 5 — Wizard 5
**Gain**
- Spells: **Fireball**, **Counterspell**

**Play style (Level 5)**
- This is a major identity spike: open hard with **Fireball** when enemies are grouped, then clean up survivors.
- Keep a reaction ready for **Counterspell** when enemy casters are present—denying a big spell is often better than dealing damage.

### Level 6 — Wizard 6
**Gain**
- Spells: **Haste**, **Hold Person**

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Treat **Haste** as your “tempo switch”: use it in difficult fights to snowball actions and end threats early.
- **Hold Person** is your premium control pick—use it to remove the most dangerous humanoid from the fight (or enable an easy kill).

### Level 7 — Wizard 7
**Gain**
- Spells: **Blight**, **Ice Storm**

**Play style (Level 7)**
- You now have strong choices for both single-target and area pressure: pick the spell that ends the fight faster, not the fanciest one.
- Use your mobility to keep distance, then drop big areas where your frontline *isn’t*—don’t win the fight and lose your party to friendly fire.

### Level 8 — Wizard 8
**Feat**
- **Lucky**

**Gain**
- Spells: **Conjure Minor Elemental**, **Confusion**

**Play style (Level 8)**
- **Lucky** is your “save the run” button—use it to protect concentration, avoid critical failures, or force key outcomes.
- Your fights become control-heavy: **Confusion** can shut down packs, while summons add bodies to soak hits and disrupt enemies.

### Level 9 — Wizard 9
**Gain**
- Spells: **Cone of Cold**, **Conjure Elemental**

**Play style (Level 9)**
- **Cone of Cold** is your big AoE finisher—look for lines/cones that hit many targets without clipping allies.
- Start fights by establishing control and position, then spend your highest-level slot to end the enemy’s ability to take meaningful turns.

### Level 10 — Wizard 10
**Gain**
- Cantrip: **Friends**
- Spells: **Banishment**, **Seeming**

**Play style (Level 10)**
- **Banishment** is your “remove the problem” tool—use it on the scariest enemy when you need breathing room or a safe reset.
- Keep playing clean turns: one big action that matters, then use movement/positioning so enemies waste their turns trying to reach you.

### Level 11 — Wizard 11
**Gain**
- Spells: **Disintegrate**, **Chain Lightning**

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Your endgame damage identity is online: use **Disintegrate** to delete a priority target, and **Chain Lightning** when enemies clump into 3–6 packs.
- Be intentional with spell learning: you have limited high-level slots, so prioritize the spells you will actually cast in hard fights.

### Level 12 — Wizard 12
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Intelligence**

**Gain**
- Spells: **Greater Invisibility**, **Telekinesis**
- Prepared spell suggestion includes **Conjure Elemental** as a strong out-of-combat cast with your level 5 slots.

**Play style (Level 12)**
- You’re now a complete kit: rotate between AoE nukes, single-target deletion, and hard control depending on what ends the fight fastest.
- Use **Greater Invisibility** / **Telekinesis** as flexible problem-solvers when raw damage isn’t the answer (priority isolation, throws, repositioning, or control).

# Best consumables / items (single-use)
- **Potion of Greater Healing**  
  - What it does: *8d4 + 8 healing and removes burning.*  
  - Why it’s strong: keeps you alive when cloth defenses get pressured and lets you stay upright without spending a combat turn on defensive casting.  
  - When to use: after you take focus-fire, on fights where you must maintain concentration, or when you can’t safely reposition.

- **Potion of Invisibility**  
  - What it does: *Become invisible for 1 minute. Attacking or casting spells ends the status.*  
  - Why it’s strong: emergency reset for a fragile backliner—breaks enemy targeting and buys space to reposition.  
  - When to use: when you’re about to be collapsed on, to escape bad high-ground angles, or to reset after a risky opening.

- **Potion of Flying**  
  - What it does: *10 turns of flying.*  
  - Why it’s strong: solves positioning—high ground, line-of-sight, and “can’t reach me” turns that keep you alive while you cast.  
  - When to use: big vertical arenas, fights with dangerous melee jumpers, or any encounter where you need to kite safely.

- **Potion of Speed**  
  - What it does: *3 turns of an increased action via the Haste condition.*  
  - Why it’s strong: turns you into a tempo machine (more actions per turn means you end fights before enemies stabilize).  
  - When to use: bosses, difficult encounters, or any fight where you need to remove multiple threats immediately.

- **Potion of Angelic Slumber**  
  - What it does: *fall asleep for two turns, then restore all spell slots, hit points, and abilities.*  
  - Why it’s strong: a “hard refill” that can let you keep pushing without a full rest—especially valuable if you’ve burned high-level slots.  
  - When to use: safe moments in longer adventuring stretches, or right before a major fight chain if you can protect yourself for two turns.

- **Elixir of Bloodlust**  
  - What it does: *once per turn on kill: 5 temp HP + additional action.*  
  - Why it’s strong: snowballs fights—kills turn into more actions, which turn into more kills.  
  - When to use: encounters with multiple weaker enemies where you can reliably secure finishing blows.

- **Elixir of Peerless Focus**  
  - What it does: *gain advantage on concentration saves (ingredients Sublimate of Belladona, and any ashes).*  
  - Why it’s strong: concentration is your lifeline—this keeps your strongest effects active through pressure.  
  - When to use: boss fights, caster-heavy fights, or any time you expect to take chip damage while maintaining concentration.

- **Elixir of Vigilance**  
  - What it does: *gain +5 bonus initiative and you cannot be surprised (ingredients sublimate of bloodstained hook, any ashes).*  
  - Why it’s strong: going first lets you lock enemies down or nuke clusters before they act.  
  - When to use: ambush-prone areas, hard encounters, and any fight where the opening turn decides the outcome.

- **Superior Elixir of Arcane Cultivation**  
  - What it does: *gain a level 3 spell slot (ingredients Solution of Night Orchid, any Vitriol).*  
  - Why it’s strong: more mid-tier slots means more control/damage consistency across multiple fights.  
  - When to use: dungeon stretches or sequences where you need sustained casting and can’t rest freely.

- **Elixir of Viciousness**  
  - What it does: *increase your critical hit chance (ingredients Vitriol of Shadowroot Sac, any Ashes).*  
  - Why it’s strong: boosts burst potential when you’re focused on ending priority targets quickly.  
  - When to use: fights where you want faster single-target kills and have a clean damage plan.

- **Elixir of Universal Resistance**  
  - What it does: *gain resistance to all damage (ingredients Vitriol of Divine Miasma, any Sublimate).*  
  - Why it’s strong: covers your biggest weakness (being fragile) and keeps you alive through chaotic fights.  
  - When to use: bosses, unknown encounters, or fights where you expect unavoidable incoming damage.

---

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
- **Cull the Weak**  
  - What it does: when you bring a creature down to fewer hit points than your number of evolved Illithid powers, it dies and all nearby creatures take *1–4 Psychic damage.*  
  - Why it’s strong here: your build frequently softens multiple enemies—this turns “almost dead” into guaranteed cleanup and accelerates fight snowballing.

- **Psionic Backlash**  
  - What it does: when an enemy within *9m* casts a spell, you can use your reaction to inflict *1d4 Psychic damage to the caster per the spell’s level.*  
  - Why it’s strong here: you’re already playing a reaction-focused backline; this punishes enemy casters while you keep your action for your own casting plan.

- **Blackhole**  
  - What it does: *Area-based suck-in that slows targets.*  
  - Why it’s strong here: grouping + slowing enemies makes your big AoE turns cleaner and safer—more enemies in the kill zone, fewer enemies reaching you.

- **Repulsor**  
  - What it does: *Massive area knockback that can hit friendlies.*  
  - Why it’s strong here: emergency space-maker—when enemies collapse on you or your team, knockback can reset the fight’s shape and buy time to cast safely.

- **Charm**  
  - What it does: you can *force enemies to attack something else.*  
  - Why it’s strong here: the guide calls this the priority power—redirecting attacks protects a fragile backliner and can immediately stabilize dangerous turns.
