## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Divination School Wizard with “Portent,” able to see into the future and change die rolls.
- Clairvoyant-style character concept focused on manipulating outcomes.
- Cloth-quarterstaff Wizard playstyle with an extra dice-manipulation mechanic.

### Core Playstyle
- AoE, utility, and control spellcasting with Divination School reactions to alter attack rolls and saving throws (Portent).
- Use Mage Armour after every Long Rest; prioritize crowd control early and scale into powerful AoE spells at Level 5+.

### Party Role
- Battlefield control (crowd control, reactions to shut down key enemy actions).
- Ranged spell damage (area and single target).
- Utility (mobility, defensive reactions, out-of-combat spells).

### Pros
- Access to the largest spell list in the game; high versatility.
- Strong AoE, utility, and control.
- Can manipulate dice outcomes with Portent; later stacks with Lucky.

### Cons
- Requires careful planning and preparation.
- Slow start until Level 5.
- Friendly fire on AoE spells (Evocation is called out as the subclass that avoids friendly fire).

### Power Spikes
- Level 2: Portent (Divination School) and subclass choice.
- Level 5: Fireball and Counterspell.
- Level 6: Expert Divination + Haste.
- Level 8: Lucky feat.
- Level 11: Level 6 spells (Disintegrate, Chain Lightning).

## Character Creation
- Race: High Half-Elf
- Class: Wizard
- Subclass: Divination
- Background: Sage
- Ability Scores: STR 8, DEX 16, CON 14, INT 16, WIS 10, CHA 10
- Proficiencies: Quarterstaves, Light Crossbows, Dagger (weapons); none (armour)
- Proficiencies (skills): Investigation and Religion
- Cantrips: Fire Bolt, Light, Mage Hand, Blade Ward
- Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Sleep, Thunderwave, Chromatic Orb, Shield

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Three cantrips
  - Two Level 1 spell slots
  - Learn six spells
  - Arcane Recovery: recover two spell slots (restore two level 1 spells or one level 2 spell)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Sleep
  - Thunderwave
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Use cloth and a quarterstaff.
    - If High Half-Elf or Human, you can equip a shield with a Quarterstaff for extra AC.
    - Use Mage Armour immediately following every long rest to boost AC (16 with 16 Dexterity; 18 AC if also using a shield).
    - Early priorities include crowd control (Sleep; Grease + Fire Bolt combination later), Thunderwave knockback, and Chromatic Orb (ice version for stuns).

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Divination School
  - Two spells; total of 5 prepared spells
  - Divination Savant (subclass feature): Learning Divination spells from scrolls costs half as much (25 gold pieces per spell level)
  - Portent (subclass feature): After each Long Rest, gain two random Portent Dice; use reaction to change the die of any nearby Attack Roll or Saving Throw to one of your Portent Dice; each die once; unused dice lost at end of day
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Sleep
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Portent is limited; use it only when you really need an attack to land or avoid (incoming crowd control, killing blow, etc.).
    - Portent can help allies.
    - In the spellbook Reactions tab, enable the “ask” checkbox so BG3 prompts you before spending Portent.
    - Suggested utility spells: Grease and Find Familiar; Grease + Fire Bolt cantrip for area damage and crowd control.
    - Flex spells mentioned: Shield (if struggling with survivability) and Sleep (depending on party crowd control).

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Two level-2 spells
  - Two new spells; total of 6 prepared spells
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
  - Misty Step
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Scorching Ray is single-target damage (can target different enemies or one).
    - Misty Step is a bonus action mobility tool; example given: Misty Step onto a ledge and use Thunderwave to knock enemies off.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - One new cantrip: Minor Illusion
  - Two spells: Flaming Sphere; Mirror Image
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (Intelligence +2)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
  - Misty Step
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Shield
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Flaming Sphere acts like a summoned creature that does damage and soaks up damage; helpful at lower levels.
    - Mirror Image is a defensive spell (AC increases by 9, decreasing by 3 as duplicates disappear when attacks are evaded).
    - In difficult fights where you will be targeted frequently, use Shield and Mirror Image to increase survivability.
    - After selecting +2 Intelligence, you can immediately go to your spellbook and add another spell; Shield or Mirror Image is called out as a good choice for survival.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Two Level-3 spell slots
  - Two spells: Fireball; Counterspell
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
  - Misty Step
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Counterspell
  - Fireball
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Counterspell uses a spell slot and Reaction to negate an enemy spell; helpful to avoid crowd control spells like Hold Person.
    - You now have Portent and Counterspell as tools to counter enemies.
    - Fireball is strong AoE early and late; note “friendly fire” (teammates can take damage if hit and fail saving throw).
    - Suggested approach: use Fireball early in fights when enemies are clumped, then switch to single-target spells.
    - If you want to prepare both Fireball and Counterspell, drop Shield if survivability is high.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Subclass feature: Expert Divination (additional Portent Die; on Short Rest, regain any spent Portent Dice)
  - Two spells: Haste; Hold Person
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
  - Misty Step
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Counterspell
  - Fireball
  - Hold Person
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Regaining Portent Dice on Short Rest allows more frequent Portent usage.
    - Haste grants an action and increases speed/defense; requires Concentration; if Concentration breaks, target becomes Lethargic and skips their turn.
    - Suggested usage: use Haste when you cannot attack with a Fireball on turn one, and hide to avoid damage.
    - Look to prepare Hold Person for crowd control, Mirror Image for survival, and Haste for group utility.
    - “Ending Act 1 with a Divination Wizard” notes:
      - You should be close to completing Act 1 content around Level 6.
      - Visit merchants and stock up on camp and alchemy supplies.
      - Look over best Act 1 items and permanent bonuses.
      - Grymforge has powerful armor and weapons (Adamantine) that can aid into Act 3; consider crafting before transitioning to Act 2 because you won’t be able to come back to the map.

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - 1 level 4 spell slot
  - Two spells: Blight; Ice Storm
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
  - Misty Step
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Counterspell
  - Fireball
  - Hold Person
  - Blight
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Take Ice Storm (area damage) and Blight (single target); Blight is high single-target damage but lower range so you’ll need to be in the fray to use it.
    - Other options mentioned: Banishment (single target stun), Confusion (AoE crowd control), Conjure Minor Elemental (summons).

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Another Level 4 spell slot
  - Two spells: Conjure Minor Elemental; Confusion
  - Feat: Lucky (3 Luck Points to gain Advantage on Attack Rolls/Ability Checks/Saving Throws, or make an enemy reroll Attack Rolls)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
  - Misty Step
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Counterspell
  - Fireball
  - Hold Person
  - Blight
  - Confusion
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Lucky is described as leaning into the Divination subclass’ controlling mechanism; enable it in reactions and passives to influence dice rolls.
    - Lucky and Portent “stack,” allowing layered control.
    - For spell selection, take Confusion for crowd control and prepare it; Ice Storm can be prepared for more area damage; Conjure Minor Elemental is noted if you want summons.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - One level 5 spell slot
  - Two spells: Cone of Cold; Conjure Elemental
  - 13 prepared spells available to select from
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
  - Misty Step
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Counterspell
  - Fireball
  - Hold Person
  - Blight
  - Confusion
  - Cone of Cold
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Cone of Cold is conal, described as easier to aim and avoid friendly fire than radial spells.
    - If you selected Minor Elemental, you can replace it with Conjure Elemental if you like summons.
    - Cloudkill is not suggested here (hard to avoid damage in its massive radius).

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Another level 5 spell slot
  - Subclass features: Third Eye: Darkvision (24m); Third Eye: See Invisibility
  - One new cantrip: Friends
  - Two spells: Banishment; Seeming
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
  - Misty Step
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Counterspell
  - Fireball
  - Hold Person
  - Blight
  - Confusion
  - Cone of Cold
  - Banishment
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Banishment is described as one of the best single-target CC in the game.
    - Seeming is described as a great out-of-combat utility spell.
    - Note given: these Third Eye features don’t influence the build that much; the guide states it isn’t multiclassing this build because level 6 spells are powerful.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - 1 level 6 spell slot
  - Two spells: Disintegrate; Chain Lightning
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
  - Misty Step
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Counterspell
  - Fireball
  - Hold Person
  - Blight
  - Confusion
  - Cone of Cold
  - Banishment
  - Disintegrate
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - You will only get one level 6 spell slot unless you pick one of two quarterstaves: Staff of Spellpower or Markoheshkir; these have a passive that forgoes one spell slot and gives a free cast.
    - The guide suggests selecting two level 6 spells with the intent to collect one or both of these staffs in Act 3.
    - Disintegrate is called out as a powerful single-target damage spell; Chain Lightning is described as great area-based damage when enemies are close and in packs.

  - Feat: Ability Improvement (Intelligence +2)
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour

  - Misty Step
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Counterspell
  - Fireball
  - Hold Person
  - Blight
  - Confusion
  - Cone of Cold
  - Banishment
  - Disintegrate
  - Conjure Elemental
  - Telekinesis
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Another +2 Intelligence allows preparing another spell; the guide suggests Conjure Elemental (cast outside combat; with 3 level 5 slots you can still use two powerful level 5 spells).
    - The guide calls Greater Invisibility and Telekinesis “utility spells” to round out the build.
    - Summary provided in the guide:
      - Single Target Damage: Scorching Ray, Magic Missile, Blight, Disintegrate
      - Area Damage: Fireball, Cone of Cold, Chromatic Orb

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Pre-Buff: Always cast Mage Armour following a long rest to maintain 16 or higher AC.
2. Bonus Action: Don’t forget your bonus action for a potion or Misty Step.
3. Use Environment: Combine a fire spell with Grease and coat the area with fire damage or water and electrical,
4. Knockback: Combine a big knockback with Misty Step and create distance whenever you can to survive.
5. Area Damage: Don’t hit allies with friendly fire and point or aim your spells to avoid allies.
6. Rest Constantly: Your spell slots will quickly run out after one or more fights, especially if challenging.
7. Positioning: Look to move back in distance and even use Hide to prevent damage from coming in.
8. Crowd Control: Make sure you focus on taking out the primary target with Sleep, Hold Person, or any other CC to limit potential damage.
9. Big Nuke: Typically, you want to fire off your big spells early to finish off targets before they can attack you.
10. Use Consumables: One of the best early consumables is the Potion of Speed for two actions per turn.

## Alternative Build Route
For the alternative Divination Wizard build:
- Start at Level 1 by choosing Warlock with the Hexblade subclass.
- This grants early access to the cantrips Eldritch Blast and Booming Blade, plus proficiencies in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons for better early durability.
- If you prefer robes, take Mage Armour at Level 3 for extra defense.
- While the guide focuses on the Divination subclass, it recommends taking Evocation here for stronger synergy with offensive and AoE spells.
- You’ll miss an extra feat at Level 12 due to multiclassing, but the increased survivability and early damage potential make up for it.
- This build delivers solid damage from the start and remains effective through the endgame.

Level Class Selection
- 1 Warlock: Subclass: Hexblade, Eldritch Blast, Booming Blade, Hex, Shield
- 2 Wizard: Firebolt, Mage Hand, Friends, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile, Longstrider, Shield, Thunderwave, Find Familiar
- 3 Wizard: Subclass: Evocation, Mage Armour, Protection from Good and Evil
- 4 Wizard: Misty Step, Scorching Ray
- 5 Wizard: Bursting Sinew, Mirror Image, Blur, Feat: +2 Intelligence
- 6 Wizard: Fireball, Counterspell
- 7 Wizard: Haste, Glyph of Warding
- 8 Wizard: Conjure Minor Elemental, Ice Storm
- 9 Wizard: Banishment, Blight, Shocking Grasp, Feat: Spell Sniper
- 10 Wizard: Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold
- 11 Wizard: Toll of the Dead, Hold Monster, Confusion
- 12 Wizard: Disintegration, Globe of Invulnerability

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- “This build page has been updated for the Patch 8 version of Baldur’s Gate 3.”
- Patch 8 adds the Bladesinging subclass and Booming Blade cantrip, allowing Wizards to excel in melee combat.
- The described agile, front-line playstyle trades some traditional spellcasting power for increased mobility, AC, and consistent melee damage.
- For more versatility, a one-level dip into Hexblade Warlock adds armor and weapon proficiencies and access to Eldritch Blast, boosting both defense and early-game damage.
- The guide notes you lose a feat at Level 12 with multiclassing, but overall combat flexibility makes the hybrid build a strong and fun alternative, with exact progression in the alternative build section.
