## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- “The best way to play the Bladesinging Wizard is to use a high strength build with Shadow Blade and multiclass into Paladin for Divine Smite.”
- “Drink an Elixir of Cloud Giant Strength to boost your overall strength to 27.”
- “Use a bonus action to summon Shadow Blade, which deals psychic damage and scales off of Strength.”
- “Make sure to obtain the Resonance stone in Act 2, which doubles Psychic Damage, including for Shadow Blade.”
- “With your action, attack in melee range and trigger Divine Smites with Shadow Blade.”
- Loot Everything: “You will need a lot of gold to buy consumables, potions, and ammunition so loot and sell constantly.”
- Crafting: “Elixirs and potions are vital, and you need to purchase materials when trading for crafting.”
- Reach Level 6: “Spend the early part of the game completing every quest to reach level 6 where your power dramatically increases.”
- Sell Often: “Your carrying capacity will be limited so sell often, and store excessive items in your traveler’s chest.”
- Stealth: “Start combat in stealth if at all possible to trigger the Surprise status effect.”
- Consider Illithid Powers: “While it can come with an altered appearance, the powers are powerful and can help you.”
- Oils + Elixiris: “Combine both oils/coatings and elixirs during combat for a dual benefit.”
- Persuasion: “Try to avoid combat through dialogue if possible.”
- Best tip section: “pre-buff with spells like Mirror Image, Shadow Blade, and Elixir of Hill Giant Strength. Next, crouch to enter stealth and start combat with Thunderous Smite to trigger the Surprised status effect. From this point, use your actions for melee attacks and trigger Divine Smite to deal extra damage. Use your bonus action for misty step and potions or consumables.”

## Alternative Build Route
For the alternative Wizard build:
- Start at Level 1 by taking a level in Hexblade Warlock.
  - Early access to Eldritch Blast and Booming Blade.
  - Proficiencies in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.
  - Improves early-game durability and makes frontline combat more manageable.
  - If you’d rather wear traditional robes, “grab Mage Armour at Wizard Level 3 for a reliable defensive boost.”
- While Bladesinging is the intended core of this guide, it recommends considering Evocation here instead “for its strong synergy with offensive cantrips and area-of-effect spells,” maximizing damage while minimizing friendly fire.

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- “Patch 8 of Baldur’s Gate 3 brings major changes to the Wizard class with the introduction of the Bladesinging subclass and the Booming Blade cantrip, offering a fresh, melee-oriented playstyle.”
- Bladesingers “gain enhanced mobility, increased AC, and the ability to weave spells and swordplay together seamlessly.”
- Booming Blade “delivering reliable, scaling melee damage,” encouraging a “skirmisher combat approach.”
- Trade-off: “reduced focus on high-level spellcasting and utility compared to more traditional Wizard builds.”
- Patch 8 also describes: 12 new subclasses including Bladesinging Wizard; introduces “new spell Shadow Blade, and Cantrip Booming Blade,” giving Wizard “a viable melee burst damage that can rival Barbarian’s Paladin’s and Fighter’s.”
