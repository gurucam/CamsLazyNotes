## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- An **intelligent martial spellcaster** who focuses on defensive positioning and high AC.
- Plays like a **high-mobility duelist** who uses their high AC to safely cast concentration spells in melee.
- The **Bladesong** feature allows for both powerful melee attacks and the casting of full Wizard spells, making them extremely versatile.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- Activate your primary subclass feature to boost your defenses and speed, then engage in melee combat while maintaining powerful area control or utility spells.

### Party role
- Frontline Controller, High-AC Melee Striker, and Utility Caster.

### Key stats
- **Intelligence (INT)**: Primary ability score for Spell Attack, Spell Save DC, and for increasing Bladesong AC.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Secondary stat for Armour Class (AC), Initiative, and Weapon Attack Rolls.
- **Constitution (CON)**: Important for hit points and maintaining Concentration on key spells.

### Best Race
- **High Elf/Half-Elf**: Provides proficiency in Longswords and Longbows, which are essential for the Bladesinger.
- **Githyanki**: Provides Medium Armor proficiency, which is a great defensive boost before Bladesong is available.

### Recommended Background
- Sage (Arcana, History) or Noble (Persuasion, History).

## Character creation

## Level-by-level progression (Wizard 1 → 12)

#### Level 1
##### GAIN
- Class features (Arcane Recovery, Spellcasting).
- Spells (*Mage Armour*, *Shield*, *Magic Missile*).

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 1)
- You are a vulnerable pure caster at this stage. Use *Mage Armour* for a base defense and rely on *Magic Missile* for reliable damage.
- Prioritize positioning and staying out of melee, as you are extremely squishy without your subclass features.

#### Level 2
##### GAIN
- Subclass: Bladesinger.
- Feature: Bladesong.
- Spells (e.g., *Misty Step*).

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 2)
- You are now a true Bladesinger. Use your **Bladesong** as your first bonus action in any serious fight to boost AC and movement.
- You can now safely approach the frontline, but still save spell slots for *Shield* as a reaction to turn misses into hits.

#### Level 3
##### GAIN
- Level 2 Spell Slots.
- Spells (e.g., *Misty Step*, *Invisibility*).

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 3)
- *Misty Step* is now your most valuable tool, allowing you to reposition out of danger or close the distance to a high-priority target as a bonus action.
- Use utility spells like *Invisibility* to scout ahead, bypass obstacles, or prepare for combat.

#### Level 4
##### GAIN
- Feat (Ability Score Improvement: +2 INT).
- Spells.

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 4)
- Use this ASI to cap INT at 18 now for better Spell Save DC and a higher Bladesong AC boost.
- This level is about improving consistency for your spells and defense; focus on landing those powerful crowd control spells.

#### Level 5
##### GAIN
- Level 3 Spell Slots.
- Spells (e.g., *Haste*, *Fireball*).

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 5)
- **Haste** is the core power spike. Cast it on yourself immediately to gain an extra action for an attack or cantrip.
- Focus your concentration on *Haste* as losing it is extremely dangerous; use *Shield* and your high AC to maintain it.

#### Level 6
##### GAIN
- Feature: Extra Attack (replace one attack with a cantrip).
- Spells.

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 6)
- Your combat rotation is now complex and powerful: Bladesong → *Haste* → Attack + Cantrip (e.g., *Fire Bolt*).
- Use the Cantrip replacement feature to maintain high melee damage while still benefiting from INT scaling.

#### Level 7
##### GAIN
- Level 4 Spell Slots.
- Spells (e.g., *Wall of Fire*, *Greater Invisibility*).

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 7)
- *Wall of Fire* offers excellent area denial, dividing the battlefield and softening up enemies.
- Use *Greater Invisibility* defensively to gain Advantage on attacks and severely impair enemy targeting.

#### Level 8
##### GAIN
- Feat (Ability Score Improvement: +2 INT).
- Spells.

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 8)
- Cap INT at 20 for maximum effect on all spells and defense.
- This ensures your Bladesong AC is maximized and your spells are difficult to save against.

#### Level 9
##### GAIN
- Level 5 Spell Slots.
- Spells (e.g., *Hold Monster*, *Cone of Cold*).

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 9)
- *Hold Monster* is a powerful single-target control option that can instantly win a boss fight if they fail the saving throw.
- Save your 5th level slots for high-impact effects that can immediately swing a fight.

#### Level 10
##### GAIN
- Feature: Song of Defense.
- Spells.

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 10)
- **Song of Defense** gives you a reliable way to reduce incoming damage using spell slots as a reaction.
- Use this when *Shield* isn't enough or when facing massive burst damage that could otherwise knock you down.

#### Level 11
##### GAIN
- Level 6 Spell Slots.
- Spells (e.g., *Disintegrate*, *Chain Lightning*).

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 11)
- You now have access to truly game-changing burst spells like *Disintegrate* for single-target deletion.
- Continue to maintain *Haste* and use your melee attacks to finish targets, conserving the 6th level slot for the biggest threat.

#### Level 12
##### GAIN
- Feat (Tough or War Caster).
- Spells.

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 12)
- Take **War Caster** to gain Advantage on Concentration saves, making it nearly impossible to lose *Haste*.
- Your turn should be dedicated to maximizing damage (attack/cantrip combo) while maintaining your powerful concentration buff.

## Best consumables / items (single-use)
Consumables are essential for difficult encounters, allowing you to maximize your limited high-level resources and defensibility.

- **Potion of Speed** — *The single best consumable for burst turns and AC.*
  - **What it does:** Grants an extra action, +2 AC, advantage on Dexterity saves, and doubles movement for the turn.
  - **Why it's strong:** Allows you to activate Bladesong, cast *Haste*, and still get a full turn of attacks/spells. It also grants +2 AC, stacking with Bladesong for maximum defense.
  - **When to use:** Reserve for boss fights or high-stakes encounters where you need both maximum offense and defense immediately.

- **Elixir of Vigilance** — *Guarantees you act first, allowing for crucial setup.*
  - **What it does:** Grants a permanent **+5 Initiative** and prevents you from being Surprised (until Long Rest).
  - **Why it's strong:** As a controller, going first is critical. It ensures you can cast *Haste* or a major control spell like *Hold Monster* before the enemies can act.
  - **When to use:** Apply at the beginning of the day for important dungeon crawls or before major ambush scenarios.

- **Superior Elixir of Arcane Cultivation** — *Provides an extra resource for high-level spells.*
  - **What it does:** Grants an additional 6th level spell slot (until Long Rest).
  - **Why it's strong:** Wizards are limited in their highest-level slots. This provides an extra use of *Disintegrate* or *Chain Lightning* when it matters most.
  - **When to use:** Use on days where multiple boss fights or difficult encounters are expected.

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
The Bladesinger benefits from powers that increase its burst damage potential and defensive capabilities without using up valuable spell slots.

- **Luck of the Far Realms** — *Transforms damage into assured critical hits.*
  - **What it does:** Allows you to use a reaction to turn any successful attack roll into a Critical Hit.
  - **Why it synergizes:** You make many attack rolls with your melee weapon and the Cantrip replacement feature. Use this on a high-damage strike combined with a powerful buff to delete a priority target.

- **Psionic Backlash** — *A powerful, resource-free counter-defense.*
  - **What it does:** Deals Psychic damage to an enemy when they cast a spell against you.
  - **Why it synergizes:** You are in melee, drawing more attention from enemy spellcasters. This punishes them for targeting the highly defensible Bladesinger without consuming your spell slot or reaction needed for *Shield*.

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- **Bladesinger Wizard (10) / Fighter (2)**
  - This route sacrifices the final Feat and the 6th level spell slot (losing *Disintegrate*).
  - **GAIN:** Action Surge (an extra full action once per Short Rest) and the Great Weapon Fighting Style.
  - **Why it's good:** Action Surge is arguably the strongest ability in the game. It allows you to cast a concentration spell (like *Haste*) and still get a full turn of attacks/cantrips in the same round, drastically boosting your opening burst potential.
