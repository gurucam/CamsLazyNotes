## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Wizards class is renowned for their spellcasting prowess and unmatched versatility.
- We will select the Abjuration subclass which excels at providing support and protection to your more heavy-hitting DPS party members.
- Their protection spells feed into the subclass feature Arcane Ward, which is a shield that is amplified by casting Abjuration spells.

### Core Playstyle
- Focus on providing support and protection via Abjuration spells that feed Arcane Ward, while using area-of-effect spells, utility, and control as needed.

### Party Role
- Support and protection for allies (Arcane Ward / Projected Ward).
- Area-of-effect damage, utility, and control.

### Pros
- Access to the largest spell list in the game, enabling them to adapt to various situations.
- Improves the whole party’s survivability with Arcane Ward.

### Cons
- They may require careful planning and preparation.
- Expect a slow start until you reach level 5.

### Power Spikes
- Level 5 (Fireball and Counterspell)
- Level 6 (Projected Ward)
- Level 10 (Improved Abjuration)
- Level 11 (Level 6 spell slot; Globe of Invulnerability)

  - Abjuration Wizard Level 1 Prepared Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Sleep.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:
    - Use Mage Armour immediately following every long rest.
    - Focus on crowd control (Sleep, Grease, and Fire Bolt combination).
    - Thunderwave as a knockout, and Chromatic Orb for stuns (Chromatic Orb can be cast using Ice which can knock enemies prone).
    - Priorities early are:
      - Complete Prologue
      - Recruit Companions
      - Unlock Withers, respec companions to proper class/ability score

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Abjuration
  - Spell Selection: Shield, Find Familiar
  - Abjuration Savant (subclass feature)
  - Arcane Ward (subclass feature)
  - At level two the Wizard picks their subclass. They get two spells and will have a total of 5 prepared spells.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Abjuration Wizard Level 2 Prepared Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Sleep, Ice Knife
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:
    - Arcane Ward is the core mechanic behind the build.
    - The most common Abjuration spells early on are Mages Armour and Shield.
    - Find Familiar is very useful for exploring holes which normal-size party members cannot enter (swap prepared spells as needed).
    - Shield consumes a reaction, which is passive and doesn’t affect your action and bonus action resource.
    - Combat remains the same, and you can slot Ice Knife which is a great area-based ranged damage ability at this level.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Spell Selection: Scorching Ray, Misty Step
  - At Level 3 the Abjuration Wizard unlocks two level 2 spells, and gets to select two new spells with a total of 6 prepared spells.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Abjuration Wizard Level 3 Prepared Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Sleep, Scorching Ray, Misty Step
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:
    - Drop Ice Knife and add Misty Step as the second level two spell.
    - Keep a level 2 spell slot free just for Misty Step to escape melee pressure.
    - Both the Amulet of Misty Step and Circlet of Blasting give one free use per Long Rest which can be very useful at the start of the game with limited spell slots.
    - TLDR: use Scorching Ray once, then save a level 2 spell slots for Misty Step to flee fights.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Cantrip Selection: Blade Ward
  - Spell Selection: Flaming Sphere, Mirror Image
  - Feat: Magic Initiate Warlock
    - Eldritch Blast (feat cantrip)
    - Mage Hand (feat cantrip)
    - Hellish Rebuke (feat spell)
  - At level 4 the Abjuration Wizard unlocks 1 new cantrip, two spells, and your first feat.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Abjuration Wizard Level 4 Prepared Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Sleep, Scorching Ray, Misty Step, Flaming Sphere
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:
    - The reason we take this and not an Ability Improvement is, that we want to still progress our Wizard to level 12 for the level 6 spell slot and utility.
    - Warlock Initiate is very helpful, providing access to the Eldritch Blast cantrip.
    - Hellish Rebuke is another reaction-based spell; combine this with Shield to increase survivability, lower damage with Arcane Ward, and return fire.
    - Flaming Sphere is helpful at this level as well since it’s a summon, although requires concentration.
    - If you struggle with survivability: drop Sleep for Shield and drop Flaming Sphere for Mirror Image.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Spell Selection: Fireball, Counterspell
  - At level 5 the Abjuration Wizard unlocks 2 level 3 spell slots, and selects two spells with 8 prepared spells.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Abjuration Wizard Level 5 Prepared Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Scorching Ray, Misty Step, Flaming Sphere, Fireball, Counterspell.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:
    - Counterspell is a reaction that doesn’t consume an action or reaction.
    - Leave one level 3 spell slot in reserve during hard fights for Counterspell.
    - Fireball is devastating if you cast it on allies; avoid hitting friends and use it on a group of enemies only.
    - For prepared spell loadout: add Fireball and drop Sleep (crowd control) for Counterspell (weak crowd control from this level forward).

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Spell Selection: Haste, Animate Dead
  - Projected Ward (subclass feature)
  - At level 6 the Abjuration Wizard unlocks and selects two spells.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Abjuration Wizard Level 6 Prepared Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Scorching Ray, Misty Step, Fireball, Counterspell, Animate Dead, Shield.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:
    - Projected Ward allows you to shield and lower damage from allies; it will reward you for casting more Abjuration spells because you want to pump up the number absorbed by this feature.
    - Use Animate Dead post-fight: find a corpse and turn it into an ally (lasts until Long Rest).
    - Drop Flaming Sphere and rely on Animate Dead as a stronger, non-concentration-based spell.
    - Ending Act 1: check traders and stock up on camp and alchemy supplies; Grymforge has powerful armor and weapons (Adamantine).

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Spell Selection: Stoneskin, Conjure Minor Elemental
  - At level 7 the Abjuration Wizard unlocks 1 level 4 spell slot and selects two new spells to learn.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Abjuration Wizard Level 7 Prepared Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Scorching Ray, Misty Step, Fireball, Counterspell, Animate Dead, Shield, Stoneskin
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:
    - Conjure Minor Elemental is recommended; the Ice Mephit is the choice here because it does great range damage and can knock enemies prone.
    - Stoneskin is a defensive Abjuration spell; requires concentration but lasts until Long Rest and can be cast outside of combat.
    - With every long rest you will be casting a lot of spells: Mage Armour, Animate Dead, Stoneskin and eventually Minor Elemental.

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Spell Selection: Banishment, Ice Storm
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Intelligence)
  - At level 8 the Abjuration Wizard unlocks another level 4 spell slot, learns two new spells, and selects one feat.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Abjuration Wizard Level 8 Prepared Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Scorching Ray, Misty Step, Fireball, Counterspell, Animate Dead, Shield, Stoneskin, Conjure Minor Elemental
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:
    - Slot Conjure Minor Elemental and add it into rotation post Long Rest.
    - Banishment is a powerful single-target crowd control effect (swap in for difficult fights).
    - Ice Storm is a powerful cold area-based damage ability; radius is big and you’re likely to hit your party members.
    - You can experiment with these spells via scrolls and thus not consume spell slots.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Spell Selection: Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold
  - At level 9 the Abjuration Wizard unlocks 1 level 5 spell, learns 2 new spells, and has 13 prepared spells to select from.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Abjuration Wizard Level 9 Prepared Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Scorching Ray, Misty Step, Fireball, Counterspell, Animate Dead, Shield, Stoneskin, Conjure Minor Elemental, Conjure Elemental
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:
    - Add Conjure Elemental and Ice Storm to your spellbook.
    - Do not add Cone of Cold at this level because the level 5 slot will be used for Conjure Elemental post Long Rest.
    - Summons stack in Baldur’s Gate 3, including Minor Elemental, Animate Dead, and Conjure Elemental.

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Cantrip Selection: Light
  - Spell Selection: Planar Binding, Greater Invisibility
  - Improved Abjuration (subclass feature)
  - At level 10 the Abjuration Wizard unlocks another level 5 spell slot, subclass feature, learns one new cantrip, two new spells.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Abjuration Wizard Level 10 Prepared Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Scorching Ray, Misty Step, Fireball, Counterspell, Animate Dead, Shield, Stoneskin, Conjure Minor Elemental, Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:
    - Slot Cone of Cold for area damage (easier to aim and less likely to hit allies than Ice Storm or Fireball).
    - Improved Abjuration increases Arcane Ward via Short Rests; if entering a very difficult fight post long-rest, Short Rest one time to ensure this ward is strong.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Spell Selection: Globe of Invulnerability, Create Undead
  - At level 11 the Abjuration Wizard unlocks 1 level 6 spell slot, learns two spells.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Abjuration Wizard Level 11 Prepared Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Scorching Ray, Misty Step, Fireball, Counterspell, Animate Dead, Shield, Stoneskin, Conjure Minor Elemental, Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold, Globe of Invulnerability
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:
    - You will only get one level 6 spell slot unless you pick Staff of Spellpower or Markoheshkir (passive gives a free cast).
    - Globe of Invulnerability is an Abjuration spell and the recommended selection (“oh crap” button).
    - Create Undead can be useful post long-rest finding corpses.

### Level 12

  - Spell Selection: Cloudkill, Blight
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Intelligence)
  - At level 12 the build learns two new spells and one feat.

- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:

## Illithid Powers
- Shield of Thralls: This can be a useful defensive shield when expecting or taking pressure.
- Freecast: Utterly god-tier feature to pair with metamagic making your build obscenely strong because you can cast essentially three spells in one turn. Put together Quickened spell (2x) and Freecast with bonus action (3x).
- Reflective Shell: A protective shell envelops you. It reflects any projectiles targeted at you to their point of origin. Does not affect creatures that don’t rely on sight or that can see through illusions.
- Repulsor: Massive area knockback that can hit friendlies.
- Charm: This is the priority power you want to obtain because you can force enemies to attack something else.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Pre-Buff: Always cast Mage Armour following a long rest. This will keep you alive and oftentimes you will forget it falls off.
2. Bonus Action: Don’t forget your bonus action – you can use a potion of healing or speed to increase your survivability.
3. Environment: Remember you can create environmental damage. Combine Grease with a fire spell and coat the area with fire damage.
4. Knockback: Having a spell-like Thunderwave is essential to handling pressure from enemies.
5. Area Damage: Your priority should be creating big area damage. Think of ways to hit multiple targets directly or with environmental damage to inflict the most damage at once.
6. Rest Constantly: Your spell slots will quickly run out in challenging fights. Resting and using resources is a small-time commitment, but it’s the difference between life and death when you enter combat.
7. Positioning: Keeping your distance and casting spells is how you successfully do damage. When needed, look to move back or even use Hide to prevent incoming damage.
8. Crowd Control: Wizards have great crowd control options. Focus on taking out the primary target with Sleep, Hold Person, or any other CC to limit potential damage.
9. Big Nuke: Typically, you want to cast your big spells early to finish off targets before they can attack. But save at least one of your spell slots for a critical moment. Usually, I do this for Misty Step as it’s a ‘get-out’ card.
10. Use Consumables: One of the best early consumables is the Potion of Speed. This gives you an extra action and essentially doubles your combat potential for a few turns.

## Alternative Build Route
- Begin at Level 1 as a Warlock with the Hexblade subclass:
  - Provides early access to Eldritch Blast and Booming Blade, along with proficiencies in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons, greatly improving early-game durability.
  - Prefer lighter gear? Pick up Mage Armour at Wizard Level 3 for a solid defensive boost.
  - You’ll lose a feat at Level 12 due to multiclassing, but the added survivability and early-game damage more than compensate.
- Alternative build progression (as listed):
  - Level 1 Warlock: Subclass: Hexblade, Eldritch Blast, Booming Blade, Hex, Shield
  - Level 2 Wizard: Firebolt, Mage Hand, Friends, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile, Longstrider, Shield, Thunderwave, Find Familiar
  - Level 3 Wizard: Subclass: Evocation, Mage Armour, Protection from Good and Evil
  - Level 4 Wizard: Misty Step, Scorching Ray
  - Level 5 Wizard: Bursting Sinew, Mirror Image, Blur, Feat: +2 Intelligence
  - Level 6 Wizard: Fireball, Counterspell
  - Level 7 Wizard: Haste, Glyph of Warding
  - Level 8 Wizard: Conjure Minor Elemental, Ice Storm
  - Level 9 Wizard: Banishment, Blight, Shocking Grasp, Feat: Spell Sniper
  - Level 10 Wizard: Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold
  - Level 11 Wizard: Toll of the Dead, Hold Monster, Confusion
  - Level 12 Wizard: Disintegration, Globe of Invulnerability
- Although this guide centers on the Abjuration subclass, it suggests considering the Evocation subclass instead for better synergy with offensive and area-of-effect spells.

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 of Baldur’s Gate 3 transforms the Wizard class with the introduction of the Bladesinging subclass and the Booming Blade cantrip, enabling Wizards to thrive in melee combat.
- This nimble, frontline style shifts away from pure spellcasting, offering enhanced mobility, higher AC, and reliable melee damage.
- For added flexibility, taking a one-level dip into Hexblade Warlock grants armor and weapon proficiencies, plus access to Eldritch Blast, boosting both survivability and early-game offense.
- While this hybrid approach sacrifices a feat at Level 12, the increased combat versatility makes it a powerful and enjoyable alternative.

### Patch 7
- The release of Patch 7 for BG3 brought with it no significant combat, gameplay, or build-related change for the Abjuration Wizard.
- The main focus of this update was the final narrative additions mostly centered around evil endings, along with official modding tools and adjustments to honour mode.
- The game now features a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager, allowing players to create and install mods directly within the game.
