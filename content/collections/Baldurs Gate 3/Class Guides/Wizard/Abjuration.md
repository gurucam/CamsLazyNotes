# Best consumables / items (single-use)
- **Potion of Speed** — Grants an extra action, +2 AC, and advantage on Dexterity saves for 3 turns.
  - **What it does:** The extra action is the primary benefit, allowing you to cast two full spells in a single turn, such as a large control spell followed by a major defensive one like *Globe of Invulnerability*.
  - **Why it’s strong:** This effectively doubles your utility output in a critical turn, which is perfect for either a massive defensive play or a huge burst of damage/control.
  - **When to use it:** Reserve for boss fights or highly difficult encounters where you need to guarantee a fight-winning utility spell is cast, or when you need dual defensive actions.

- **Elixir of Vigilance** — Grants a permanent **+5 initiative** and immunity to being Surprised.
  - **What it does:** Drastically increases your chance of acting first in combat.
  - **Why it’s strong:** For an Abjuration Wizard, going first is critical. It allows you to use your defensive and utility spells, such as **Banishment** or **Web**, before the enemies get a chance to act, securing a tactical advantage.
  - **When to use it:** Consume after every Long Rest if available, specifically before any challenging fight where winning the initiative roll is essential for battlefield control.

- **Elixir of Hill Giant Strength** — Sets the user's Strength score to **21** until a Long Rest.
  - **What it does:** Increases your raw physical strength and carrying capacity.
  - **Why it’s strong:** While not a damage boost, the high Strength significantly improves your jump distance, which helps greatly with crucial repositioning, escaping danger, and reaching inaccessible areas.
  - **When to use it:** Use before every Long Rest, similar to the Elixir of Vigilance, as the effect lasts until your next rest.

- **Oil of Accuracy** — Weapon coating that grants a permanent **+2 Attack Rolls**.
  - **What it does:** Provides a straight bonus to all attack rolls made with the weapon.
  - **Why it’s strong:** This reliably increases the hit chance for your spell attack roll Cantrips like **Fire Bolt** or **Ray of Frost**, ensuring your low-resource options remain consistent throughout the game.
  - **When to use it:** Apply before any combat encounter to ensure your ranged Cantrips are reliable when you need to conserve your valuable spell slots.

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
- **Blackhole**
  - **What the power does:** Creates a massive vacuum that pulls all enemies into a centralized area and applies a Slowing effect.
  - **Why it synergizes:** This power is ideal for setting up your AoE control. It perfectly groups enemies, allowing you to cast **Fireball** and **Ice Storm** for guaranteed maximum value and damage efficiency, ensuring you clear the area safely.

- **Cull the Weak**
  - **What the power does:** When you kill an enemy, nearby enemies with low HP are executed, and surrounding targets take Psychic damage.
  - **Why it synergizes:** This power is the ultimate finisher for area casters. After landing a massive AoE spell, Cull the Weak triggers a lethal chain reaction that clears the battlefield and maintains your action economy advantage.

- **Repulsor**
  - **What the power does:** A massive area-of-effect knockback that pushes all creatures away from the caster.
  - **Why it synergizes:** This serves as a powerful defensive feature. Use it to instantly create space when surrounded, or offensively to push targets directly into your environmental hazards or control zones like **Web**.
