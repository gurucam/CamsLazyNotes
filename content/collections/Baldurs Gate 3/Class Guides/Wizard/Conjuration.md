## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Conjuration subclass with additional mobility and summon ally spells.
- Summoning creatures to support you in combat.
- A Wizard that has high defensive survival skills.

### Core Playstyle
- Combination of area spell damage, crowd control, and defensive spells for survival, with summons supporting you in combat.

### Party Role
- Area spell damage
- Crowd control
- Defensive / survival-focused caster

### Pros
- Additional mobility and teleportation tools.
- Summon ally spells (multiple summons can stack).
- Strong defensive tools (reaction-based and preemptive defensive spells).

### Cons
- Slow start until level 5.
- Area spells can hit friendlies.
- Summoning after every long rest can take time.

### Power Spikes
- Level 5: “big jump in power” with Fireball and Animate Dead.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Summon: make sure to summon allies to fight for you as it’s the premise of the build!
2. Mobility: Misty Step is your best mobility tool so save a level 2 spell slot for it.
3. Teleport: You can gain another teleport with your subclass at level 6 and it recharges by using conjuration spells.
4. Potions: Consider potion of speed a game changer because you get an additional action for 3 turns.
5. Stack Summons: as you level, cast multiple elementals and dead because they stack together.
6. Elements: Use different elements to light the ground on fire or electrocute the area.
7. Prepare: Feel free to change your spells in between fights depending on your playstyle and needs.
8. Cantrips: Use cantrips frequently when starting because your spell slots will be limited.
9. Long Rest: cast your summons and Mage Armour post every long rest.
10. Cloth: Make sure to never wear armour or it will lower your AC and mess up set bonuses.

## Alternative Build Route
- Start at Level 1 by choosing the Warlock class with the Hexblade subclass.
- Gains early access to Eldritch Blast and Booming Blade, plus proficiencies in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.
- If you prefer to stick with traditional robes or clothing, take Mage Armour at Level 3 for added defense.
- This setup misses an extra feat at Level 12 due to multiclassing.
- The guide states: “Although this guide focuses on the Conjuration school, we actually recommend pairing it with Evocation for better synergy with offensive cantrips and AOE spells.”

Alternative Level Progression (as listed):
- Level 1: Warlock — Subclass: Hexblade, Eldritch Blast, Booming Blade, Hex, Shield
- Level 2: Wizard — Firebolt, Mage Hand, Friends, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile, Longstrider, Shield, Thunderwave, Find Familiar
- Level 3: Wizard — Subclass: Evocation, Mage Armour, Protection from Good and Evil
- Level 4: Wizard — Misty Step, Scorching Ray
- Level 5: Wizard — Bursting Sinew, Mirror Image, Blur, Feat: +2 Intelligence
- Level 6: Wizard — Fireball, Counterspell
- Level 7: Wizard — Haste, Glyph of Warding
- Level 8: Wizard — Conjure Minor Elemental, Ice Storm
- Level 9: Wizard — Banishment, Blight, Shocking Grasp, Feat: Spell Sniper
- Level 10: Wizard — Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold
- Level 11: Wizard — Toll of the Dead, Hold Monster, Confusion
- Level 12: Wizard — Disintegration, Globe of Invulnerability

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 introduces the Bladesinging subclass and the Booming Blade cantrip.
- Bladesinging “boosts survivability with increased AC and mobility,” while Booming Blade “adds reliable melee damage that scales well.”
- The guide notes this path means “giving up some of the raw spellcasting power and utility offered by more traditional subclasses.”
- The guide also discusses a one-level dip into Warlock (Hexblade) for armor and weapon proficiencies, plus cantrips like Eldritch Blast, with the tradeoff of sacrificing an extra feat at Level 12.

### Patch 7
- The release of Patch 7 brought “no significant combat, gameplay, or build-related change for the Conjuration Wizard.”
- Patch 7 also added a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager.
