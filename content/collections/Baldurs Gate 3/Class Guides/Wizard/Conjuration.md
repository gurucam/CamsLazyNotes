## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A powerful **arcane mage** that controls the battlefield using crowd control spells and area damage.
- You primarily play as a **summoner**, keeping multiple allied creatures on the field to deal damage and draw enemy attention.
- The Conjuration subclass offers **high defensive survival** via mobility tools and the ability to maintain Concentration on key spells.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- The Conjuration Wizard manipulates the battlefield by summoning creatures to fight alongside them, controlling enemy movement with powerful crowd control, and protecting themselves with defensive utility spells.

### Party role
- **High-threat Controller:** Provides high damage, summons, and essential crowd control to restrict enemy movement and action economy.

## Character creation

### Race
- **Wood Elf:** Grants the highest movement speed and Darkvision, which is excellent for positioning a fragile caster.
- **Githyanki:** Provides light/medium armor and Greatsword proficiency, or a free spell that grants an extra action (depending on the specific guide’s recommendations).

### Background
- **Sage:** Recommended for the proficiencies in Arcana and History (Intelligence checks).
- **Guild Artisan:** Alternative choice for Insight and Persuasion proficiencies.

### Class
- Wizard (Conjuration Subclass).

### Ability scores (point buy)

## Level-by-level progression (Wizard 1 → 12)

### Level 1 (Wizard)
#### GAIN
- Class Unlock: Wizard
- Feature: Arcane Recovery
- Cantrips: Fire Bolt, Ray of Frost, Minor Illusion
- Spells: Mage Armour, Shield, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile, Fog Cloud, Grease

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 1)
- The first action in almost any fight should be casting **Mage Armour** for a reliable increase to your AC (until a Long Rest).
- Use **Magic Missile** when you absolutely need guaranteed damage, or **Chromatic Orb** for burst damage when you have a good hit chance.
- Use **Grease** or **Fog Cloud** defensively to block vision or create difficult terrain in chokepoints.

### Level 2 (Wizard)
#### GAIN
- Subclass Unlock: Conjuration
- Subclass Feature: Minor Conjuration (Level 1)
- Spells: Lesser Restoration, Feather Fall

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 2)
- You gain the **Minor Conjuration** ability, which allows you to teleport a short distance after casting any Conjuration spell.
- This ability is a core defensive tool; use it to instantly reposition, escape threatened zones, or reach high ground.

### Level 3 (Wizard)
#### GAIN
- Level 2 Spells Unlocked
- Spells: Misty Step, Web

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 3)
- **Web** is your main Level 2 crowd control spell—cast it to restrain groups of enemies. You can combine it with **Fire Bolt** or **Chromatic Orb** to create a massive fire area on the webbed ground.
- **Misty Step** provides powerful bonus-action mobility for escaping danger or chasing down priority targets.

### Level 4 (Wizard)
#### GAIN
- Feat: Warcaster
- Cantrip: Blade Ward
- Spells: Shutter, Darkness

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 4)
- Taking the **Warcaster** feat is vital as it gives you advantage on Concentration Saving Throws, helping you keep powerful control spells like Web, Haste, and later, Conjure Elemental, active.
- Use **Shutter** for area damage when enemies are tightly grouped together, as it is non-Concentration.

### Level 5 (Wizard)
#### GAIN
- Level 3 Spells Unlocked
- Spells: Counterspell, Fireball

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 5)
- **Fireball** becomes your absolute main damage tool. Cast it on clustered enemies for massive, reliable area damage.
- **Counterspell** is the best defensive reaction in the game; always prioritize using it to stop high-threat enemy casters from casting their most dangerous spells.

### Level 6 (Wizard)
#### GAIN
- Subclass Feature: Focused Conjuration (Level 6)
- Spells: Haste, Lightning Bolt

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 6)
- **Focused Conjuration** is the core of this build: your Concentration on Conjuration spells (like Web and Haste) cannot be broken due to taking damage.
- You can now safely cast **Haste** on an allied martial character or yourself without fear of losing Concentration, granting an extra action every turn.

### Level 7 (Wizard)
#### GAIN
- Level 4 Spells Unlocked
- Spells: Ice Storm, Banishment

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 7)
- **Ice Storm** provides excellent dual-utility: high area damage combined with the ability to knock enemies Prone, increasing its crowd control potential.
- **Banishment** is an emergency button. Use it to temporarily remove a single high-threat boss or enemy from the combat for two turns, allowing you to deal with surrounding threats first.

### Level 8 (Wizard)
#### GAIN
- Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 INT)
- Spells: Dimension Door, Conjure Minor Elemental

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 8)
- Your Intelligence score should now be 19. This immediately improves your Spell Save DC for all control spells.
- **Conjure Minor Elemental** gives you a dedicated, permanent follower (until Long Rest). This ally contributes consistent damage and acts as a valuable distraction for enemies.

### Level 9 (Wizard)
#### GAIN
- Level 5 Spells Unlocked
- Spells: Wall of Stone, Conjure Elemental

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 9)
- **Conjure Elemental** summons a far more powerful permanent ally than the Minor Elemental. This is a massive increase to your fighting strength.
- **Wall of Stone** is an extremely high utility spell. Use it to divide the battlefield, block chokepoints, or prevent enemies from reaching your backline.

### Level 10 (Wizard)
#### GAIN
- Cantrip: Shocking Grasp
- Spells: Animate Dead, Cone of Cold

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 10)
- Cast **Animate Dead** to gain another permanent follower. By now, you should have multiple summons on the field to draw fire and deal damage.
- **Cone of Cold** is your premier high-damage, non-Concentration area damage spell. Use it when you need raw burst damage on a large group in close proximity.

### Level 11 (Wizard)
#### GAIN
- Level 6 Spells Unlocked
- Spells: Chain Lightning, Circle of Death

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 11)
- Level 6 spells are extremely powerful and should be reserved for boss encounters.
- **Chain Lightning** is an excellent option for clearing groups of enemies with high damage and reliable targeting.

### Level 12 (Wizard)
#### GAIN
- Feat: Ability Improvement (+1 INT)
- Spells: Arcane Gate, Disintegrate

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 12)
- Your final Intelligence score is 20.
- **Disintegrate** is a powerful single-target nuke for eliminating bosses or high-HP enemies.
- **Arcane Gate** offers massive, instantaneous battlefield repositioning for your entire party. Use it to bypass obstacles or retreat to safety.

# Best consumables / items (single-use)
- **Potion of Speed** — Grants an extra action, +2 AC, and advantage on Dexterity saves for 3 turns.
  - **What it does:** The extra action is the key benefit, allowing you to cast two full spells or a spell and a utility action in a single turn.
  - **Why it’s strong:** This effectively doubles your offensive output and allows for game-changing burst damage, which is perfect for clearing a wave of enemies.
  - **When to use it:** Reserve for boss fights, highly difficult encounters, or when you absolutely must end a fight in 1–2 turns.

- **Elixir of Vigilance** — Grants a permanent **+5 initiative** and immunity to being Surprised.
  - **What it does:** Drastically increases your chance of acting first in combat.
  - **Why it’s strong:** For a control Wizard, going first is critical. It allows you to cast a powerful crowd control spell (like Web or Ice Storm) before the enemies can move or attack, winning the fight before it starts.
  - **When to use it:** Best consumed after every Long Rest if you have a supply, specifically before any challenging fight where winning the initiative roll is essential.

- **Elixir of Hill Giant Strength** — Sets the user's Strength score to **21** until a Long Rest.
  - **What it does:** Increases your raw physical strength and carrying capacity.
  - **Why it’s strong:** While not a damage elixir for a Wizard, it is incredibly useful for improving jump distance, which helps with critical repositioning and escaping chokepoints.
  - **When to use it:** Use before every Long Rest, similar to the Elixir of Vigilance, as the effect lasts until your next rest.

- **Oil of Accuracy** — Weapon coating that grants a permanent **+2 Attack Rolls**.
  - **What it does:** Provides a straight bonus to all attack rolls made with the weapon.
  - **Why it’s strong:** This reliably increases the hit chance for your spell attack roll spells like **Fire Bolt** or **Ray of Frost**.
  - **When to use it:** Apply before any combat encounter to ensure your Cantrips and low-level attack spells are consistent.

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
- **Blackhole**
  - **What the power does:** Creates a massive vacuum that pulls enemies into a centralized area and applies a Slowing effect.
  - **Why it synergizes:** This power is designed for AoE casters. It perfectly groups enemies, setting them up for guaranteed maximum value from spells like **Fireball**, **Ice Storm**, or **Cone of Cold**, drastically increasing your damage efficiency.

- **Cull the Weak**
  - **What the power does:** When you kill an enemy, nearby enemies with low HP are executed, and surrounding targets take Psychic damage.
  - **Why it synergizes:** This power is the ultimate finisher. After landing a massive AoE spell on a group, Cull the Weak triggers a chain reaction, ensuring all damaged enemies are finished off and preventing them from getting another turn.

- **Repulsor**
  - **What the power does:** A massive area-of-effect knockback that pushes all creatures away from the caster.
  - **Why it synergizes:** This is a crucial defensive and utility tool for a Conjuration Wizard. You can use it to push enemies into your persistent crowd control areas like **Web** or **Grease**. It is also highly effective for instantly creating distance when you are surrounded.
