## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **master of deception**, using the largest spell list in the game to manipulate the battlefield, confuse enemies, and deliver massive area-of-effect (AoE) damage from a safe distance.
- Plays like an **omnipotent control specialist**: You dictate the pace of every fight by taking the first turn and shutting down or repositioning priority targets before they can act.
- Your power comes from spell slot management and excellent positioning. You trade frontline durability for unmatched versatility in utility, control, and blast power.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- Master the largest spell list in the game to control encounters, manipulate enemies with deception, and drop powerful area-of-effect damage from a safe distance.

### Party role
- **Backline Controller/Blaster:** Unmatched utility and AoE damage potential, prioritizing locking down the majority of enemies to allow allies to clean up threats.

## Character creation

### Race
- **High Elf**
  - **Why:** The single best choice for a Wizard, granting you a free, extra **Cantrip** which you can use to supplement your existing list. They also gain **Proficiency in Longswords**, which is useful for utility if you plan to use armor via multiclassing or feats.

### Background
- **Sage**
  - **Why:** Adds Proficiency in **Arcana** and **History**. These are both Intelligence-based skills, ensuring you leverage your primary stat for the most important knowledge checks in the game.

### Skills
- **Arcana** (From Sage)
- **Investigation**
- **Why:** These skills maximize the benefit of your high Intelligence score, ensuring you succeed at critical checks and find hidden objects.

### Level 1 Ability Scores (Start)
| Stat | Value | Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **STR** | 8 | Dump stat, not needed for spellcasting. |
| **DEX** | 14 | Improves Initiative, AC, and Dexterity Saves. |
| **CON** | 15 | Vital for HP and maintaining **Concentration** on spells. |
| **INT** | 17 | **Primary Stat.** Sets your Spell Save DC and Spell Attack rolls. |
| **WIS** | 10 | Neutral; avoids penalties on common Perception/Insight checks. |
| **CHA** | 8 | Dump stat. |

## Level-by-level progression (Wizard 1 → 12)

### Level 1
#### GAIN
- Wizard Class (Learning Spells, Spell Slots, Arcane Recovery)
- Spell Slots: 2x Lvl 1
- Spells: **Magic Missile**, **Shield**, **Longstrider**, **Fog Cloud**, **Minor Illusion** (Cantrip), **Ray of Frost** (Cantrip)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 1)
- **Prioritize:** Utility and control cantrips, especially **Minor Illusion**, to manipulate enemy positioning or distract guards.
- **Typical Turn:** Use **Magic Missile** to guarantee damage against high-AC targets, or apply **Longstrider** to your party before combat.
- **Spend Resources:** Conserve your two Lvl 1 slots for **Shield** (reaction) when you are about to be hit, or **Sleep** if you need to shut down a group of enemies immediately.

### Level 2
#### GAIN
- Subclass Unlocked: **School of Illusion**
- Subclass Feature: **Improved Minor Illusion** (You can cast a second illusion without using an action)
- New Spells: **Grease**, **Mirror Image** (if desired)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 2)
- **Prioritize:** Leveraging **Improved Minor Illusion** to effectively draw targets into a specific area, setting up control spells or AoE damage from allies.
- **Typical Turn:** Cast **Grease** to create a difficult and hazardous surface, then use your enhanced cantrip to lure enemies into it.
- **Spend Resources:** Use **Grease** or **Sleep** to immediately neutralize crowds of low-HP targets. This is your primary control tool until Lvl 5.

### Level 3
#### GAIN
- Level 2 Spells Unlocked
- Spell Slots: 4x Lvl 1, 2x Lvl 2
- New Spells: **Web**, **Misty Step** (if desired, or through gear)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 3)
- **Prioritize:** Setting up **Web** as your main concentration spell, which can lock down multiple enemies and creates a dangerous surface.
- **Typical Turn:** Cast **Web** to control a large area. If enemies close the distance, use the **Misty Step** from your class or gear to reposition to safety.
- **Spend Resources:** Use Lvl 2 slots for **Web** in every major encounter. If you are taking too much damage, **Mirror Image** is critical for survivability.

### Level 4
#### GAIN
- **Feat** (Take **War Caster**)
- New Cantrip
- Spell Slots: 4x Lvl 1, 3x Lvl 2
- New Spells: **Scorching Ray**, **Blur**

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 4)
- **Prioritize:** Maintaining concentration on **Web** or **Blur**. **War Caster** makes this much easier by granting advantage on Concentration Saves.
- **Typical Turn:** Focus on keeping a powerful concentration spell active. Use your action for low-cost, high-impact blasts like **Scorching Ray** when control is established.
- **Spend Resources:** Now that concentration is more secure, you can use your Lvl 2 slots aggressively on control, knowing that War Caster will protect you.

### Level 5
#### GAIN
- Level 3 Spells Unlocked
- Spell Slots: 4x Lvl 1, 3x Lvl 2, 2x Lvl 3
- New Spells: **Hypnotic Pattern**, **Fireball**, **Counterspell**

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 5)
- **Prioritize:** This is a massive power spike. Your first turn should be spent casting **Hypnotic Pattern** to shut down entire encounters with a single spell.
- **Typical Turn:** Cast **Hypnotic Pattern** or **Fireball** to completely shift the fight's momentum. Use **Counterspell** as a reaction to stop enemy casters from disrupting your plan.
- **Spend Resources:** Lvl 3 slots are reserved for **Hypnotic Pattern** (control) or **Fireball** (AoE damage). Do not conserve these slots in difficult fights.

### Level 6
#### GAIN
- Subclass Feature: **Malleable Illusion** (Change the nature of an existing illusion)
- Spell Slots: 4x Lvl 1, 3x Lvl 2, 3x Lvl 3
- New Spells: **Haste** (Scrolls/Gears recommended), **Remove Curse**

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 6)
- **Prioritize:** Using **Malleable Illusion** for strategic flexibility. You can move your **Minor Illusion** to maintain enemy confusion without having to recast.
- **Typical Turn:** Maintain concentration on a control spell like **Web** or **Hypnotic Pattern**. Use your action to fire off a cantrip or support with a Lvl 1/2 spell.
- **Spend Resources:** Use your added Lvl 3 slot for an extra **Fireball** or to prepare two major control spells in one long rest.

### Level 7
#### GAIN
- Level 4 Spells Unlocked
- Spell Slots: 4x Lvl 1, 3x Lvl 2, 3x Lvl 3, 1x Lvl 4
- New Spells: **Confusion**, **Banishment**

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 7)
- **Prioritize:** **Confusion** is your main control upgrade against targets that may resist **Hypnotic Pattern** (such as high-Wisdom enemies). **Banishment** is excellent for removing a single priority target.
- **Typical Turn:** If facing a strong boss, use **Banishment** to remove them temporarily. Clean up the smaller threats, then prepare for the boss's return.
- **Spend Resources:** Lvl 4 slots are for either mass control (**Confusion**) or single-target removal (**Banishment**).

### Level 8
#### GAIN
- **Feat** (Take **Ability Improvement** to reach **INT 19**)
- Spell Slots: 4x Lvl 1, 3x Lvl 2, 3x Lvl 3, 2x Lvl 4
- New Spells: **Evard's Black Tentacles**, **Ice Storm**

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 8)
- **Prioritize:** The INT boost dramatically improves your Spell Save DC, making your Illusion spells much harder to resist. Always focus on landing a strong control spell on your first turn.
- **Typical Turn:** If enemies are clustered, **Evard's Black Tentacles** is a great follow-up control tool after an initial **Hypnotic Pattern** wears off.
- **Spend Resources:** Use your two Lvl 4 slots to maintain battlefield dominance and ensure control is always active, either via **Banishment** or **Black Tentacles**.

### Level 9
#### GAIN
- Level 5 Spells Unlocked
- Spell Slots: 4x Lvl 1, 3x Lvl 2, 3x Lvl 3, 2x Lvl 4, 1x Lvl 5
- New Spells: **Wall of Stone**, **Cone of Cold**, **Cloudkill**

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 9)
- **Prioritize:** **Wall of Stone** is an incredible utility spell for splitting the battlefield and creating cover for your party. It can turn difficult encounters into two manageable small fights.
- **Typical Turn:** Start with a control spell, then use **Wall of Stone** to cordon off one group. If facing crowds, use **Cone of Cold** or **Cloudkill** as your new, high-damage AoE options.
- **Spend Resources:** The Lvl 5 slot should be reserved for either **Wall of Stone** for its utility or a powerful AoE damage spell like **Cone of Cold**.

### Level 10
#### GAIN
- Subclass Feature: **Illusory Self** (Reaction to negate an attack)
- New Cantrip
- Spell Slots: 4x Lvl 1, 3x Lvl 2, 3x Lvl 3, 3x Lvl 4, 2x Lvl 5
- New Spells: **Telekinesis**, **Hold Monster**

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 10)
- **Prioritize:** **Illusory Self** makes you incredibly survivable. Use it only on critical hits or attacks that would break your concentration on a vital spell.
- **Typical Turn:** With this new safety net, you can position slightly more aggressively for better AoE spell placement. Your main goal remains: land the first control spell.
- **Spend Resources:** Use your additional Lvl 5 slot for high-value spells like **Hold Monster** on a single difficult boss or to set up a field-splitting **Wall of Stone**.

### Level 11
#### GAIN
- Level 6 Spells Unlocked
- Spell Slots: 4x Lvl 1, 3x Lvl 2, 3x Lvl 3, 3x Lvl 4, 2x Lvl 5, 1x Lvl 6
- New Spells: **Disintegrate**, **Globe of Invulnerability**

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 11)
- **Prioritize:** **Disintegrate** is the go-to single-target nuke for finishing high-HP enemies or bosses. **Globe of Invulnerability** is a fantastic defensive tool.
- **Typical Turn:** Cast **Globe of Invulnerability** on the party when facing enemy casters who rely on AoE. This allows your party to focus purely on offense while immune to damage.
- **Spend Resources:** The single Lvl 6 slot is either for a defensive countermeasure (**Globe**) or a fight-ending blast (**Disintegrate**).

### Level 12
#### GAIN
- **Feat** (Take **Ability Improvement** to reach **INT 20**)
- Spell Slots: 4x Lvl 1, 3x Lvl 2, 3x Lvl 3, 3x Lvl 4, 2x Lvl 5, 1x Lvl 6
- New Spells: **Mass Suggestion**, **Otiluke's Resilient Sphere**

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 12)
- **Prioritize:** With INT 20, you have maximized your Spell Save DC, making your control spells almost impossible to resist.
- **Typical Turn:** Maintain control spells and use your remaining spell slots for high-level damage or reaction spells like **Counterspell**.
- **Spend Resources:** **Mass Suggestion** is a powerful utility option that can end entire encounters before they begin.

# Best consumables / items (single-use)

- **Elixir of Vigilance**
  - **What it does:** Grants **+5 Initiative** and prevents you from being **Surprised**.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** Going first is critical for a control caster. Landing the opening **Hypnotic Pattern** or **Web** before the enemy can act often ends the fight immediately.
  - **When to use it:** Before every major fight, particularly in difficult encounters where the enemy threat is high (e.g., boss fights or ambushes).

- **Potion of Speed**
  - **What it does:** Grants the status **Haste** for 1 turn, giving you an **extra action**, +2 AC, and advantage on Dexterity Saves.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** Allows for an incredible burst turn where you can drop a major control spell (like **Hypnotic Pattern**) AND follow it up with a high-damage AoE (like **Fireball**).
  - **When to use it:** Essential for burst turns against bosses or when you absolutely must clear the field in a single round.

- **Scroll of Protection from Evil and Good**
  - **What it does:** Grants the target protection from Fiends, Undead, and Aberrations, giving these enemies disadvantage on attack rolls against the protected creature.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** You are the concentration caster. Applying this to yourself grants significant protection against attacks from affected creatures, helping you maintain a critical concentration spell.
  - **When to use it:** Use immediately before or during fights against fiends, undead, or aberrations (common in Act 2 and 3).

- **Elixir of Battlemage’s Power**
  - **What it does:** Grants advantage on Concentration checks (similar to War Caster) until the next Long Rest.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** Stacks with War Caster to make breaking your concentration nearly impossible, allowing you to secure the battlefield with powerful ongoing effects.
  - **When to use it:** Before major dungeons or complex boss fights where you need to maintain a single, powerful concentration spell for the entire duration.

---

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)

- **Black Hole**
  - **What the power does:** Creates a massive vacuum that pulls all nearby creatures together and slows them (Slowed).
  - **Why it synergizes with the build:** This is the ultimate setup tool for an AoE caster. It clumps enemies into one tight group, guaranteeing that your **Fireball**, **Hypnotic Pattern**, or **Cone of Cold** hits the maximum number of targets.

- **Luck of the Far Realms**
  - **What the power does:** Allows you to turn a successful hit into a Critical Hit (once per Short Rest).
  - **Why it synergizes with the build:** While primarily a martial power, it can be used to guarantee a critical hit on a powerful single-target spell like **Disintegrate** or an important **Scorching Ray** against a priority target, ensuring they are deleted immediately.

- **Displacer Beast**
  - **What the power does:** Allows you to transform into a Displacer Beast with a high temporary hit point buffer.
  - **Why it synergizes with the build:** Provides a massive temporary hit point buffer, damage resistance, and mobility for a typically squishy caster. It serves as an excellent emergency "panic button" when you are overwhelmed or need to survive a sudden burst of damage.

---

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)

- **Illusion Wizard (10) / Fighter (2)**
  - If you want the ultimate burst damage and control potential, the guide suggests taking two levels of **Fighter** at the end. This grants you **Action Surge**, allowing you to cast two full-action spells in a single turn (e.g., **Hypnotic Pattern** followed by **Fireball**), which can completely end an encounter before the enemy acts. You sacrifice the final Feat/ASI and a handful of utility spells but gain unparalleled burst utility.

- **Illusion Wizard (11) / Cleric (1)**
  - Taking one level of **Life Cleric** (or a similar domain) grants you proficiency in **Heavy Armor** and **Shields** (depending on the domain), dramatically increasing your AC and durability, allowing you to focus on Constitution for better Concentration Saves. You sacrifice the final Feat/ASI but gain immense survivability without the need for the **Mage Armour** spell.
