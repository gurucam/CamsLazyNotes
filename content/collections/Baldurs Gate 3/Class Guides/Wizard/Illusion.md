## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Pre-Buff: Always cast Mage Armour following a long rest to maintain 16 or higher AC.
- Bonus Action: Don’t forget your bonus action for a potion or Misty Step.
- Use Environment: Combine a fire spell with Grease and coat the area with fire damage or water and electrical.
- Knockback: Combine a big knockback with Misty Step and create distance whenever you can to survive.
- Area Damage: Don’t hit allies with friendly fire and point or aim your spells to avoid allies.
- Rest Constantly: Your spell slots will quickly run out after one or more fights, especially if challenging.
- Positioning: Look to move back in distance and even use Hide to prevent damage from coming in.
- Crowd Control: Make sure you focus on taking out the primary target with Sleep, Hold Person, or any other CC to limit potential damage.
- Big Nuke: Typically, you want to fire off your big spells early to finish off targets before they can attack you.
- Use Consumables: One of the best early consumables is the Potion of Speed for two actions per turn.

## Alternative Build Route
For the alternative build, begin at Level 1 by selecting the Warlock class with the Hexblade subclass. This grants you Eldritch Blast and Booming Blade along with weapon and armor proficiencies, allowing you to equip more durable gear instead of relying solely on robes. If you continue wearing clothing, pick up Mage Armour at Level 3 for added protection. For this alternate build, use the Evocation subclass. The major sacrifice is that you will loose out on an additional feat at Level 12.

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- The most significant update to the Wizard class in Patch 8 is the introduction of the Bladesinging subclass and the Booming Blade cantrip.
- These additions enable Wizards to perform effectively in melee combat, offering a more versatile and aggressive playstyle, at the cost of enhanced spellcasting capabilities supported by many of the more traditional Wizard subclasses.
- A one-level dip into the Warlock’s Hexblade subclass provides valuable proficiencies and combat bonuses (outlined in the alternative build route).
