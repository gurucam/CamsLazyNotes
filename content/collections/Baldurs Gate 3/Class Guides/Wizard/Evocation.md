## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **backline artillery wizard** that wins fights by dropping **huge area damage** and controlling space, while staying safe with pre-buffs and smart positioning.
- The subclass identity is simple: you’re built to throw **big AoE** without the usual “friendly fire” headaches, so you can play aggressively even in tight formations.
- Early game is a **slow start** until your level 3 spells come online; from there, your damage ramps hard and your tool kit expands into utility and control.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Stay at range, pre-buff defensively, and prioritize hitting multiple enemies at once while controlling space so the fight ends before you get pressured.**

### Party role
- **Primary AoE damage:** your default job is deleting clumps and softening entire encounters.
- **Battlefield control:** you bring knockback, slows, stuns, and “remove a target” buttons when a fight needs breathing room.
- **Utility support:** you can enable the team with mobility and defensive options while still playing as a damage-first caster.

### Pros
- Extremely strong **area damage** once your spell tiers ramp (especially after level 5)
- Huge spell flexibility (swap prepared spells as needed; learn more from scrolls)
- Easy to play around allies in melee thanks to subclass safety

### Cons
- **Low durability** and can get punished if pressured or caught out of position
- Can feel **complex** due to spell selection, preparation, and resource pacing
- Early levels can feel slow until your big spells arrive

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Evocation features** (safety pockets for allies + cheaper Evocation scroll learning)
- Level 5: access to **level 3 spells** and your first “this is a wizard” damage moment
- Level 7–9: bigger spell tiers and access to major control/utility + persistent summons
- Level 11–12: top-tier single-target and encounter-warping options at the final spell tier

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** High Half-Elf
- **Class:** Wizard
- **Subclass:** Evocation
- **Background:** Sage
- **Skills:** Investigation, Religion
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 14 / INT 16 / WIS 10 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why High Half-Elf)
- Extra Cantrip, Fey Ancestry, Darkvision, and Shield Proficiency.
- *Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* Human (Shield Proficiency, Carry Capacity, Skill Proficiency).

### Starting setup
- **Preferred weapon:** Quarterstaff
- **Preferred armor:** Clothing
- **Core class mechanics to remember:** Arcane Recovery (once per day out of combat, replenish expended spell slots), and Wizards can learn spells from scrolls by paying gold.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Always cast Mage Armour following every long rest.
- If Human or Half-Elf, find and equip a shield.
- Prioritize supplies for camps, alchemy material, and scrolls; consume scrolls that have useful spells to learn them.
- Early game focus: have a knockback, area damage, single target damage, and stuns; exchange prepared spells and experiment for your party.

## Level-by-level progression (Wizard 1 → 12)
> Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop.

### Level 1 — Wizard 1
**Gain**
- **Cantrips:** Ray of Frost, Acid Splash, Fire Bolt
- **Spells to learn:** Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Thunderwave, Grease, Sleep, Chromatic Orb
- **Arcane Recovery**

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Pre-buff Mage Armour after every long rest, then play at range and avoid getting pressured.
- Prioritize early crowd control and space control (Sleep/Grease-style turns) and use a knockback option if enemies close.
- Conserve slots where you can and use cantrip damage when resources are low.

### Level 2 — Wizard 2 (Evocation)
**Subclass**
- **Evocation**

**Gain**
- **Sculpt Spells**
- **Evocation Savant**
- **Spells to learn:** Find Familiar, Feather Fall

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Lean into area effects more confidently because your subclass makes AoE easier to use around allies.
- Use cantrips for baseline damage when you’re low on slots; keep a knockback option ready if you get pressured.
- Keep Mage Armour as your default “always on” daily routine.

### Level 3 — Wizard 3
**Gain**
- **Spells to learn:** Misty Step, Scorching Ray

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Use Scorching Ray when you need focused damage (single target) or to pick off multiple weak enemies efficiently.
- Treat Misty Step as your “get out” button when positioning goes wrong—bonus action mobility lets you keep your action for offense.
- If survivability feels shaky, rotate prepared spells to include more defensive options as needed.

### Level 4 — Wizard 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Intelligence**

**Gain**
- **Spells to learn:** Flaming Sphere, Mirror Image
- **Cantrip to learn:** Blade Ward

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Open big melee brawls by adding a distraction tool (Flaming Sphere-style play) if you’re not using another concentration option.
- Your turn plan is still “control space, then damage”: lean on your reliable single-target and flexible damage spells.
- If you’re dying repeatedly to ranged or melee pressure, swap in stronger defenses and play more conservatively with position.

### Level 5 — Wizard 5
**Gain**
- **Spells to learn:** Fireball, Haste

**Play style (Level 5)**
- This is your “wizard feels powerful” breakpoint: prioritize big AoE turns that hit clusters cleanly and end fights early.
- Use Haste as utility when it meaningfully shifts the fight (especially on allies that convert actions into major value).
- Keep a single-target option prepared for enemies you must delete quickly.

### Level 6 — Wizard 6
**Gain**
- **Potent Cantrip**
- **Spells to learn:** Counterspell, Glyph of Warding

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Add reaction-based control to your plan: reserve resources so you can answer dangerous enemy casts at key moments.
- Use trap-style placement options when you can control enemy movement or predict choke points.
- Before leaving Act 1, check merchants, stock up on camp/alchemy supplies, and consider Grymforge crafting since you can’t return after transitioning.

### Level 7 — Wizard 7
**Gain**
- **Spells to learn:** Ice Storm, Banishment

**Play style (Level 7)**
- You now have bigger “hit a whole zone” turns: prioritize massive area damage when enemies stack up.
- Use a single-target “remove threat” option when something is too dangerous to leave active while you clean up the rest.
- If survival is an issue, rotate your prepared list to include more mobility/defense while keeping at least one major AoE spell available.

### Level 8 — Wizard 8
**Feat**
- **Spell Sniper**

**Gain**
- **Spells to learn:** Greater Invisibility, Blight
- **Cantrip to learn:** Eldritch Blast

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Keep playing “AoE first,” but you now have better single-target pressure for priority enemies.
- Use your upgraded cantrip plan when slots are running low so you can keep contributing without panic-resting.
- Your utility expands: be willing to spend resources to prevent pressure from ever reaching you.

### Level 9 — Wizard 9
**Gain**
- **Spells to learn:** Cloudkill, Conjure Elemental

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Apply persistent area damage when enemies aren’t resistant to your usual options, and force them to move or suffer.
- Conjure Elemental-style pressure lets you add a durable ally without concentration—use it to stabilize difficult fights.
- Rotate prepared spells based on what the encounter resists; don’t force one damage type into every situation.

### Level 10 — Wizard 10
**Gain**
- **Empowered Evocation**
- **Spells to learn:** Telekinesis, Cone of Cold
- **Cantrip to learn:** True Strike

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Your evocation damage gets a meaningful bump; prioritize your best AoE turns to capitalize on that scaling.
- Use repositioning/terrain abuse when possible—removing enemies via environment can win fights instantly.
- Keep your distance: this level rewards smart line-of-sight and spacing more than “standing and trading.”

### Level 11 — Wizard 11
**Gain**
- **Spells to learn:** Disintegrate, Globe of Invulnerability

**Play style (Level 11)**
- You now have a “delete one thing” button for critical targets—save it for moments that decide the fight.
- When pressure is overwhelming, use your strongest defensive bubble option to stabilize and reset the tempo.
- Keep at least one slot in reserve for emergencies (especially mobility/defense moments).

### Level 12 — Wizard 12
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Intelligence**

**Gain**
- **Spells to learn:** Chain Lightning, Create Undead

**Play style (Level 12)**
- You should feel extremely strong: swap prepared spells freely to match the encounter (survival set vs AoE set vs single-target set).
- Start fights by spending your biggest resources early if it ends the encounter before enemies act; keep one “escape” option ready.
- Use your highest-tier spells when the enemy density or target priority justifies the slot.

# Best consumables / items (single-use)
- **Elixir of Bloodlust**
  - What it does: once per turn when you kill a foe, you gain **5 temporary hit points** and an **additional action**.
  - Why it’s strong here: turns your best AoE turns into fight-ending chains once enemies start dropping.
  - When to use: big encounters with lots of targets; fights where you expect to secure at least one kill early.

- **Potion of Speed**
  - What it does: **3 turns** of an increased action via the **Haste condition**.
  - Why it’s strong here: doubles your tempo—more casts in the short window that matters most.
  - When to use: bosses, hard openers, and any fight where “end it in 2–3 turns” is the plan.

- **Potion of Angelic Slumber**
  - What it does: you fall asleep for **two turns**, then it restores **all spell slots, hit points, and abilities**.
  - Why it’s strong here: wizards are spell-slot limited; this can let you “go all-in” and then recover mid-run.
  - When to use: long dungeon sequences or when you need to be fully reset without leaving the zone.

- **Potion of Invisibility**
  - What it does: become invisible for **1 minute**; attacking or casting spells ends the status.
  - Why it’s strong here: buys you a safe reposition/reset when you’re about to be collapsed on.
  - When to use: emergency escapes, pre-fight positioning, or breaking pressure when enemies hard-focus you.

- **Potion of Flying**
  - What it does: **10 turns** of flying.
  - Why it’s strong here: perfect positioning is everything—flying makes it easier to land huge AoEs safely.
  - When to use: vertical arenas, fights with dangerous melee pressure, or when you need perfect angles for big spells.

- **Elixir of Peerless Focus**
  - What it does: gain **advantage on concentration saves** (ingredients Sublimate of Belladona, and any ashes).
  - Why it’s strong here: keeps your key concentration spells stable under pressure.
  - When to use: boss fights, heavy ranged pressure encounters, or whenever you’re relying on concentration to win.

- **Elixir of Vigilance**
  - What it does: gain **+5 bonus initiative** and you **cannot be surprised** (ingredients sublimate of bloodstained hook, any ashes).
  - Why it’s strong here: going early means you can land your biggest AoE/control before enemies act.
  - When to use: unknown fights, ambush-heavy zones, or encounters where the opening turn decides the outcome.

- **Superior Elixir of Arcane Cultivation**
  - What it does: gain a **level 3 spell slot** (ingredients Solution of Night Orchid, any Vitriol).
  - Why it’s strong here: more high-impact casts per day; solves the “ran out of real spells” problem.
  - When to use: difficult stretches where you can’t long rest freely, or when you need extra level 3 power.

- **Elixir of Viciousness**
  - What it does: increase your **critical hit chance** (ingredients Vitriol of Shadowroot Sac, any Ashes).
  - Why it’s strong here: improves burst potential when you’re leaning on attack-roll spells/cantrip pressure.
  - When to use: fights where you expect lots of attack rolls (especially when conserving spell slots).

- **Elixir of Universal Resistance**
  - What it does: gain **resistance to all damage** (ingredients Vitriol of Divine Miasma, any Sublimate).
  - Why it’s strong here: wizards are fragile—this is a simple “don’t die” button when the game gets lethal.
  - When to use: hardest encounters, unknown boss mechanics, or anytime you’re worried about getting deleted.

---

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
- **Shield of Thralls**
  - What it does: “This can be a useful defensive shield when expecting or taking pressure.”
  - Why it synergizes: you’re low durability; a defensive layer helps you survive the turns where enemies finally reach you.

- **Freecast**
  - What it does: “Utterly god-tier feature … you can cast essentially three spells in one turn.”
  - Why it synergizes: this build spikes hardest when it can frontload damage—Freecast supports the “big nuke early” plan.

- **Repulsor**
  - What it does: “Massive area knockback that can hit friendlies.”
  - Why it synergizes: knockback preserves your range advantage and can reset melee pressure; it also helps you control space around your AoE zones.

- **Charm**
  - What it does: “This is the priority power you want to obtain because you can force enemies to attack something else.”
  - Why it synergizes: reduces incoming pressure and buys you the time you need to safely cast and reposition.
