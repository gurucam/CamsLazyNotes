### Level 1

  - Notes:
    - Use Mage Armour immediately following every long rest.
    - If human or Half-Elf, find and equip a shield.
    - Focus on crowd control with Sleep, Grease, and Fire Bolt combination.
    - Use Thunderwave as a knockout/knockback and Chromatic Orb for stuns; Chromatic Orb using Ice can knock enemies prone.
    - Priorities early:
      - If human or Half-Elf, find and equip a shield
      - Quarterstaff with a free spell like Crones or Melf’s
      - Supplies for camps, alchemy material, and scrolls
      - Consume scrolls that have useful spells to learn them
      - Exchange spells and experiment to find the right combination for you

    - Blade Ward: take only half damage from bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing; decent when expecting incoming melee damage.

    - Use Flaming Sphere as a distraction.
    - Swap in Misty Step or Mirror Image if you struggle with survival.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Pre-Buff: Always cast Mage Armour following a long rest.
- Bonus Action: Don’t forget your bonus action – you can use a potion of healing or speed to increase survivability.
- Environment: Create environmental damage; combine Grease with a fire spell and coat the area with fire damage.
- Knockback: Having a spell-like Thunderwave is essential to handling pressure from enemies.
- Area Damage: Priority should be creating big area damage; hit multiple targets directly or with environmental damage.
- Rest Constantly: Spell slots will quickly run out in challenging fights; resting and using resources can be the difference between life and death.
- Positioning: Keep your distance and cast spells; move back or use Hide to prevent incoming damage.
- Crowd Control: Focus on taking out the primary target with Sleep, Hold Person, or other CC to limit potential damage.
- Big Nuke: Cast big spells early to finish off targets; save at least one spell slot for a critical moment (usually for Misty Step as a get-out card).
- Use Consumables: Potion of Speed is one of the best early consumables; extra action doubles combat potential for a few turns.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative Evocation Wizard build: begin at Level 1 with a dip into Hexblade Warlock.
- What the dip gives:
  - Early access to Eldritch Blast for ranged attacks and Booming Blade for melee.
  - Proficiencies in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.
  - Significant boost to early-game survivability and allows a more aggressive frontline playstyle.
  - If you prefer classic Wizard aesthetic and clothing gear: pick up Mage Armour at Wizard Level 3 to maintain solid defenses.
- Trade-off:
  - Multiclassing means sacrificing a feat at Level 12; described as “well worth it.”
  - Early access to impactful cantrips plus added durability and versatility; with Evocation’s enhanced AoE and offensive spell synergy, the hybrid build remains powerful and reliable across all stages.

Alternative leveling selections (as listed):
- Level 1 (Warlock): Subclass Hexblade, Eldritch Blast, Booming Blade, Hex, Shield
- Level 2 (Wizard): Firebolt, Mage Hand, Friends, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile, Longstrider, Shield, Thunderwave, Find Familiar
- Level 3 (Wizard): Subclass Evocation, Mage Armour, Protection from Good and Evil
- Level 4 (Wizard): Misty Step, Scorching Ray
- Level 5 (Wizard): Bursting Sinew, Mirror Image, Blur, Feat +2 Intelligence

- Level 10 (Wizard): Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold
- Level 11 (Wizard): Toll of the Dead, Hold Monster, Confusion
- Level 12 (Wizard): Disintegration, Globe of Invulnerability

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 redefines the Wizard class with the Bladesinging subclass and Booming Blade cantrip, allowing Wizards to thrive in melee combat.
- Bladesinging enhances AC and mobility.
- Booming Blade offers reliable, scaling melee damage, though at the expense of some traditional spellcasting versatility.
- To further boost early-game performance, a one-level dip into Hexblade Warlock adds weapon and armor proficiencies, plus access to Eldritch Blast.
- This increases survivability and damage from the start.
- You’ll sacrifice a Level 12 feat; result is a flexible, engaging hybrid build effective throughout the game.

### Patch 7
- Patch 7 did not bring balance, combat, or gameplay changes.
- Focus was mods and new cinematic scenes focusing on evil endings.
- Game features modding toolkit and in-game mod manager; build guide remained mostly unchanged with Patch 7.
