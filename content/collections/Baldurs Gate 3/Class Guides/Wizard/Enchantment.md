## Build Snapshot

- Focuses on mind control with a melee charm skill along with charm when being attacked.
- Persuasive and deceptive Wizards who excel at confusing enemies.

### Core Playstyle
- Crowd control early (Sleep, Grease, and Fire Bolt combination) with knockback tools and single-target damage; becomes much more powerful at level 5.

### Party Role
- Ranged-focused caster applying pressure, snaring, and debuffing the opposition.
- Utility, control, and area-of-effect spellcasting.
- Uses summons (Animate Dead / elementals / Create Undead) for damage and decoys until Long Rest.

### Pros
- Access to the largest spell list in the game, enabling adaptation to various situations.
- Excels in area-of-effect spells, utility, and control.

- Level 10: Split Enchantment + Dominate Person (target 2 creatures with single-target Enchantment spells).
- Level 11: Access to level 6 spells (noting quarterstaffs that grant a free cast via passive).

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Three cantrips, two Level 1 spell slots, and learn six spells.
  - Arcane Recovery: you can recover two spell slots (either restore two level 1 spells or one level 2 spell).
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Grease
  - Thunderwave
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Grease (area control) or Magic Missile (single-target damage) depending on the fight.
    - Turn 2+: Fire Bolt with Grease for area damage; Thunderwave for knockback when pressured.
  - Notes:
    - Gameplay revolves around Magic Missile for single-target damage, Grease with Firebolt for area damage, and Thunderwave for knockback.
    - Focus on crowd control with Sleep, Grease, and Fire Bolt combination; Thunderwave as a knockout, Chromatic Orb for stuns (Ice can knock enemies prone).
    - Wizards become much more powerful at level 5 but expect a slow start until you reach there.
    - In summary: have knockback, area damage, single target damage and stuns; freely swap prepared spells as you learn what’s best for your party composition.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Enchantment
  - Two spells and a total of 5 prepared spells.
  - Subclass features: Enchantment Savant; Hypnotic Gaze.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Grease
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Maintain Mage Armour outside combat; open with ranged control/damage (Grease / Magic Missile).
    - Turn 2+: Use Hypnotic Gaze as a melee crowd control or dialogue tool when an enemy closes the distance (3-meter range, costs an action).
  - Notes:
    - Hypnotic Gaze: Charm and Incapacitate a creature; it cannot attack you and cannot act; Maintain each turn to extend duration.
    - Hypnotic Gaze is described as a weaker crowd control spell compared to later options (further range, can hit multiple targets, prevent the enemy from taking a turn), but can be an alternative to Thunderwave when an enemy closes the distance.
    - Prepare Chromatic Orb for area damage and element selection utility.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Two level 2 spells; select two new spells; total of 6 prepared spells.
  - Spell selections: Scorching Ray, Misty Step.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Grease
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Scorching Ray for stronger single-target (or multi-target) damage.
    - Turn 2+: Misty Step (bonus action) for mobility; combo: Misty Step near a ledge and Thunderwave to knock enemies off for instant kill or big damage.
  - Notes:
    - Scorching Ray acts as a more powerful Magic Missile: choose three targets or just one for maximum damage.
    - Misty Step is a great mobility tool and uses a bonus action.
    - Prepare Scorching Ray now; next level with higher Intelligence, prepare additional spells including Misty Step.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - One new cantrip: Minor Illusion.
  - Two spells: Mirror Image, Hold Person.
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Intelligence).
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Grease
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Scorching Ray
  - Misty Step
  - Hold Person
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Hold Person on a high-damage humanoid enemy (attacks from within 3m are always Critical Hits).
    - Turn 2+: Use Mirror Image (flex) + Shield for survivability when needed; Misty Step for mobility.
  - Notes:
    - Mirror Image is a flex skill used when you need to survive tough encounters; combine with Shield for very high survivability.
    - Hold Person should be used on enemies with high damage; only cast if you have 60% or higher to succeed or it’s a wasted turn.
    - With more intelligence, prepare an additional spell; prepare both Hold Person and Misty Step.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Two level 3 spell slots; select two spells; another prepared spell.
  - Spell selections: Fireball, Counterspell.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Grease
  - Thunderwave
  - Scorching Ray
  - Misty Step
  - Hold Person
  - Counterspell
  - Fireball
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Fireball for area damage when allies are not in the radius (watch friendly fire).
    - Turn 2+: Save a level 3 spell slot for Counterspell when a critical incoming spell or crowd control is inbound.
  - Notes:
    - Fireball is one of the best area damage spells but comes with friendly fire; don’t cast it centered on companions.
    - Counterspell negates an incoming spell as a reaction; useful when you or a teammate cannot survive another attack, or when a crowd control spell like Hold Person is inbound.
    - Drop Chromatic Orb here and prepare both Fireball and Counterspell.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Subclass feature: Instinctive Charm (reaction).
  - Two spells: Animate Dead, Haste.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):

    - Turn 2+: Use Animate Dead from a Medium or Small corpse to summon a zombie until Long Rest for damage and decoys.
  - Notes:
    - Instinctive Charm: Charm an enemy attacking you; they will attack a new target if possible as a reaction; used to avoid getting attacked.
    - Animate Dead requires finding a corpse; free allies and summons help with damage and decoys.
    - Summons selected at further levels will “stack” (little army of summons) until Long Rest.
    - Ending Act 1 notes: stock up on camp/alchemy supplies; review best Act 1 items and permanent bonuses; Grymforge has powerful Adamantine armor/weapons (craft before transitioning to Act 2).

    - Turn 2+: Flex in Blight for strong single-target damage when needed.
  - Notes:
    - You will only get one level 4 spell slot at this level; using Conjure Minor Elemental helps in combat.
    - Blight can help in mid-range fights to burn down a single target.

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Another level 4 spell slot; learn two new spells; select one feat.
  - Feat: Magic Initiate Warlock (learn two cantrips and a level 1 spell from Warlock; cast the level 1 spell once per Long Rest; spellcasting ability for all 3 is Charisma).

  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Banishment to remove a powerful single target (boss) when you need to avoid being wiped.
    - Turn 2+: Use Eldritch Blast as a powerful force cantrip without consuming a spell slot; use Hellish Rebuke as a reaction when attacked.
  - Notes:
    - Confusion is better in larger fights with 6 or more enemies; Banishment is best for single-target removal.
    - In general, prepare Banishment but swap spells in or out depending on needs.

    - Turn 2+: Flex in Hold Monster for non-humanoid fighters.
  - Notes:
    - Split Enchantment described as a major power jump for single-target enchantments; Dominate Person can change the outcomes of fights.

  - Notes:
    - You will only get one level 6 spell slot unless you pick one of two powerful quarterstaffs: Staff of Spellpower or Markoheshkir (each has a passive that forgoes one spell slot and gives a free cast).

- Statue of the Gods: +2 to Saving Throws

## Illithid Powers
- Luck of the Far Realms: When you make a successful Attack Roll against a foe, you can change that hit into a Critical Hit.
- Cull of the Weak: When you bring a creature down to fewer hit points than your number of evolved Illithid powers, it dies and all nearby creatures take 1-4 Psychic damage.
- Psionic Backlash: When an enemy within 9m casts a spell, you can use your reaction to inflict 1d4 Psychic damage to the caster per the spell’s level.
- Blackhole: Area-based suck-in that slows targets.
- Repulsor: Massive area knockback that can hit friendlies.
- Charm: This is the priority power you want to obtain because you can force enemies to attack something else.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Pre-Buff: Always cast Mage Armour following a long rest. This will keep you alive and oftentimes you will forget it falls off.
2. Bonus Action: Don’t forget your bonus action – you can use a potion of healing or speed to increase your survivability.
3. Environment: Remember you can create environmental damage. Combine Grease with a fire spell and coat the area with fire damage.
4. Knockback: Having a spell-like Thunderwave is essential to handling pressure from enemies.
5. Area Damage: Your priority should be creating big area damage. Think of ways to hit multiple targets directly or with environmental damage to inflict the most damage at once.
6. Rest Constantly: Your spell slots will quickly run out in challenging fights. Resting and using resources is a small-time commitment, but it’s the difference between life and death when you enter combat.
7. Positioning: Keeping your distance and casting spells is how you successfully do damage. When needed, look to move back or even use Hide to prevent incoming damage.
8. Crowd Control: Wizards have great crowd control options. Focus on taking out the primary target with Sleep, Hold Person, or any other CC to limit potential damage.
9. Big Nuke: Typically, you want to cast your big spells early to finish off targets before they can attack. But save at least one of your spell slots for a critical moment; usually for Misty Step as it’s a ‘get-out’ card.
10. Use Consumables: One of the best early consumables is the Potion of Speed; it gives you an extra action and essentially doubles your combat potential for a few turns.

## Alternative Build Route
For the alternative Wizard build in the guide:
- Start at Level 1 as a Warlock with the Hexblade subclass (early Eldritch Blast and Booming Blade; proficiencies in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons; survivability and versatility).
- If you prefer lighter clothing, pick up Mage Armour by Level 3 for a consistent defensive boost.
- The guide recommends the Evocation subclass for the hybrid build (sculpt area spells safely around allies).
- Trade-off noted: missing out on an extra feat at Level 12 due to the Warlock dip.

Level-by-level selections listed in the guide:
- Level 1 (Warlock): Subclass: Hexblade, Eldritch Blast, Booming Blade, Hex, Shield
- Level 2 (Wizard): Firebolt, Mage Hand, Friends, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile, Longstrider, Shield, Thunderwave, Find Familiar
- Level 3 (Wizard): Subclass: Evocation, Mage Armour, Protection from Good and Evil
- Level 4 (Wizard): Misty Step, Scorching Ray
- Level 5 (Wizard): Bursting Sinew, Mirror Image, Blur, Feat: +2 Intelligence
- Level 6 (Wizard): Fireball, Counterspell
- Level 7 (Wizard): Haste, Glyph of Warding
- Level 8 (Wizard): Conjure Minor Elemental, Ice Storm
- Level 9 (Wizard): Banishment, Blight, Shocking Grasp, Feat: Spell Sniper
- Level 10 (Wizard): Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold
- Level 11 (Wizard): Toll of the Dead, Hold Monster, Confusion
- Level 12 (Wizard): Disintegration, Globe of Invulnerability

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- The guide states it has been updated for the Patch 8 version of Baldur’s Gate 3.
- Patch 8 notes in the guide:
  - Introduction of the Bladesinging subclass and the Booming Blade cantrip; these additions redefine how Wizards can be played, allowing them to step into melee combat with confidence rather than staying at a distance.
  - Trade-off described: Choosing Bladesinging means sacrificing deeper spellcasting synergy found in more traditional subclasses (powerful enhancements to raw magical output and utility).
  - The guide notes some players may opt to start with a one-level dip into Warlock (Hexblade) for armor/weapon proficiencies, Eldritch Blast, and martial synergy through Hexblade’s Curse, with a level progression provided.
