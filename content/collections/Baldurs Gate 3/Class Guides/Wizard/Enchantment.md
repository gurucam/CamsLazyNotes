#### GAIN
- Cantrip: Shocking Grasp
- Subclass Feature: Split Enchantment
- Spells: Dominate Person, Telekinesis

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 10)
- **Split Enchantment** is the final core feature: you can now target two creatures with single-target Enchantment spells (like Hold Person/Monster, Suggestion, Dominate Person) without expending an extra spell slot.

# Best consumables / items (single-use)
- **Potion of Speed** — Grants an extra action, +2 AC, and advantage on Dexterity saves for 3 turns.
  - **What it does:** The extra action is the primary benefit, allowing you to cast two full spells or a control spell followed by a powerful area damage spell in a single turn.
  - **Why it’s strong:** This effectively doubles your offensive output and allows for game-changing burst damage and dual control application, which is essential for quickly overwhelming an encounter.
  - **When to use it:** Reserve for boss fights, highly difficult encounters, or when you need to land multiple high-level control spells in the opening turns.

- **Elixir of Vigilance** — Grants a permanent **+5 initiative** and immunity to being Surprised.
  - **What it does:** Drastically increases your chance of acting first in combat.
  - **Why it’s strong:** For an Enchantment Wizard, winning the initiative roll is the difference between a controlled victory and a desperate scramble. Going first allows you to disable key enemies before they can move or attack.
  - **When to use it:** Best consumed after every Long Rest if you have a supply, specifically before any challenging fight where locking down the enemy first is critical.

- **Elixir of Hill Giant Strength** — Sets the user's Strength score to **21** until a Long Rest.
  - **What it does:** Increases your raw physical strength and carrying capacity.
  - **Why it’s strong:** While it doesn't boost spell damage, the massive increase to jump distance is incredibly useful. It helps you gain superior positioning, escape chokepoints, or reach high ground quickly.
  - **When to use it:** Use before every Long Rest, similar to the Elixir of Vigilance, as the effect lasts until your next rest.

- **Oil of Accuracy** — Weapon coating that grants a permanent **+2 Attack Rolls**.
  - **What it does:** Provides a straight bonus to all attack rolls made with the weapon.
  - **Why it’s strong:** This reliably increases the hit chance for your spell attack roll Cantrips like **Fire Bolt** or **Ray of Frost**, ensuring your low-resource options remain consistent throughout the game.
  - **When to use it:** Apply before any combat encounter to ensure your ranged Cantrips are reliable when you need to conserve spell slots.

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
- **Blackhole**
  - **What the power does:** Creates a massive vacuum that pulls all enemies into a centralized area and applies a Slowing effect.
  - **Why it synergizes:** This power is ideal for setting up your AoE control and damage. It perfectly groups enemies, allowing you to cast **Fireball**, **Ice Storm**, or **Cone of Cold** for guaranteed maximum value and damage efficiency.

- **Cull the Weak**
  - **What the power does:** When you kill an enemy, nearby enemies with low HP are executed, and surrounding targets take Psychic damage.
  - **Why it synergizes:** This is the ultimate finisher. After hitting a large group with a mass AoE spell, Cull the Weak triggers a lethal chain reaction, eliminating damaged enemies and ensuring you maintain control by denying enemy turns.

- **Repulsor**
  - **What the power does:** A massive area-of-effect knockback that pushes all creatures away from the caster.
  - **Why it synergizes:** This serves as both an offensive and defensive tool. Use it to immediately create space when surrounded, or offensively to push targets directly into your persistent control zones like a **Web** or **Grease** surface.
