## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **master of matter and energy**, specializing in powerful alteration magic to buff allies, debuff enemies, and control the flow of battle.
- Plays like an **omniscient supporter/controller**: You focus on amplifying your party's strengths with key buffs like **Haste** and nullifying enemy threats with spells like **Polymorph**.
- Your power comes from unparalleled utility and defensive capabilities, ensuring your team has every possible advantage in any encounter.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Alter enemy and ally forms** to gain tactical advantages, specializing in powerful buffs like Haste and hard control like Polymorph to neutralize key threats.

### Party role
- **Support/Controller:** Your primary role is to buff allies, debuff enemies, and control the flow of battle using concentration spells, while having high-level damage options in reserve.

## Character creation

### Race
- **High Elf**
  - **Why:** The High Elf's ability to choose a free Cantrip (like **Fire Bolt**) provides valuable supplemental damage or utility early on. They also gain **Longsword Proficiency**.

### Background
- **Sage**
  - **Why:** Grants Proficiency in **Arcana** and **History**, which utilize your primary Intelligence score for crucial knowledge checks.

### Skills
- **Arcana** (From Sage)
- **Investigation**
- **Why:** These are Intelligence-based skills that maximize the benefit of your primary stat, helping you discover secrets and information.

### Level 1 Ability Scores (Start)
| Stat | Value | Rationale |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **STR** | 8 | Dump stat, not needed for spellcasting. |
| **DEX** | 14 | Improves Initiative, AC, and Dexterity Saves. |
| **CON** | 15 | Vital for maintaining **Concentration** on powerful buff and control spells, and for HP. |
| **INT** | 17 | **Primary Stat.** Sets your Spell Save DC and Spell Attack rolls. |
| **WIS** | 10 | Neutral; avoids penalties on common checks. |
| **CHA** | 8 | Dump stat, not required for this build. |

# Best consumables / items (single-use)

- **Elixir of Vigilance**
  - **What it does:** Grants **+5 Initiative** and prevents you from being **Surprised**.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** As a control/buff caster, going first is paramount to cast **Haste** or **Polymorph** before the enemy can act or disrupt your concentration.
  - **When to use it:** Essential before every major engagement or boss fight where turning the tide on the first turn is critical.

- **Potion of Speed**
  - **What it does:** Grants the status **Haste** for 1 turn, giving you an **extra action**, +2 AC, and advantage on Dexterity Saves.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** Allows for a massive burst turn where you can cast a high-impact concentration spell (like **Haste** on an ally) AND follow up with a damage spell (like **Fireball**) or a second buff.
  - **When to use it:** Use in desperate situations or when an immediate burst of damage/utility is needed to eliminate a boss.

- **Oil of Accuracy**
  - **What it does:** Weapon coating that grants **+2 to Attack Rolls**.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** Though primarily a caster, this is useful early on for guaranteeing hits with spells that require an attack roll, such as **Scorching Ray** or **Chromatic Orb**.
  - **When to use it:** On your equipped staff before difficult fights in Acts 1 and 2 when your Spell Attack modifier is still low.

- **Elixir of Hill Giant Strength**
  - **What it does:** Sets your **Strength score to 21** until the next Long Rest.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** If you are relying on the **Transmuter's Stone** for a permanent buff, you can use the Strength-setting elixir to free up the stone for another ally.
  - **When to use it:** Use if you are multiclassing for armor proficiency or need the movement/jumping distance from a high Strength score.

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)

- **Black Hole**
  - **What the power does:** Creates a vacuum that pulls all nearby creatures together and slows them (Slowed).
  - **Why it synergizes with the build:** This is the perfect setup for your large Area-of-Effect (AoE) spells. By clumping enemies, you maximize the impact of **Fireball**, **Cone of Cold**, or **Chain Lightning**.

- **Luck of the Far Realms**
  - **What the power does:** Allows you to turn a successful hit into a Critical Hit once per Short Rest.
  - **Why it synergizes with the build:** Excellent for ensuring a high-level spell that requires an attack roll, such as **Disintegrate** or **Scorching Ray**, deals maximum damage to a boss. It turns a normal hit into a guaranteed nuke.

- **Mind Sanctuary**
  - **What the power does:** Creates an area where you can use your **Bonus Action** to cast a spell.
  - **Why it synergizes with the build:** This power grants immense action economy. It allows you to cast a powerful spell like **Haste** or **Polymorph** with your Bonus Action, leaving your full Action free for damage, movement, or a second utility spell.

---

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)

- **Transmutation Wizard (10) / Fighter (2)**
  - If you want the ultimate burst damage and control potential, take two levels of **Fighter** at the end. This grants you **Action Surge**, allowing you to cast two full-action spells in a single turn (e.g., **Haste** on an ally followed by **Fireball** or **Polymorph**). You sacrifice your final Feat/ASI but gain unparalleled burst utility.

- **Transmutation Wizard (11) / Cleric (1)**
  - Taking one level of **Life Cleric** (or a similar domain) grants you proficiency in **Heavy Armor** and **Shields** (depending on the domain), dramatically increasing your AC and durability, allowing you to focus on Constitution for better Concentration Saves. You sacrifice the final Feat/ASI but gain immense survivability without the need for the **Mage Armour** spell.
