## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- “The Transmutation subclass emphasizes the power to change matter and energy.”
- “This build will use the utility of the subclass, with Wizard raw area-based damage.”
- Transmutation Wizards are “masters of elemental magic,” using spells to “buff their allies, debuff their enemies, and create powerful effects on the battlefield.”

### Core Playstyle
- Use Wizard spellcasting to damage enemies, control the battlefield, and buff allies, with Transmutation utility.

### Party Role
- Ranged-focused spellcaster (damage and battlefield control).
- Supportive spellcasting role (buff/debuff utility).
- Provides summons and utility as spell slots expand.

### Pros
- Wide variety of spells for “damage enemies, control the battlefield, and buff their allies.”
- Subclass utility features (Experimental Alchemy, Transmuter’s Stone, Shapechanger).
- Strong power spike at level 5 with powerful spells.

### Cons
- “Wizards become much more powerful at level 5 but expect a slow start until you reach there.”
- Friendly fire risk: “The downside of your subclass is that it has ‘friendly fire’” on area spells.
- Experimental Alchemy “isn’t that helpful, due to the high 15 DC to craft another potion.”

### Power Spikes
- Level 5: “Expect a big power spike at level 5.” (Fireball and Counterspell)

## Character Creation
- Race: High Half-Elf
- Class: Wizard
- Subclass: Transmutation
- Background: Sage
- Ability Scores: STR 8, DEX 16, CON 14, INT 16, WIS 10, CHA 10
- Proficiencies: Investigation and Religion

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Cantrips: Fire Bolt, Light, Blade Ward, Mage Hand
  - Spells: Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Sleep, Thunderwave, Chromatic Orb, Shield
  - Arcane Recovery: “you can recover two spell slots… either restore two level 1 spells or one level 2 spell.”
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Sleep
  - Thunderwave
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use big spells early (the guide notes you “want to fire off your big spells early to finish off targets before they can attack you”).
    - Turn 2+: Use single-target damage and crowd control as needed (single-target damage, stuns, knockback, area damage).
  - Notes:
    - “Use Mage Armour immediately following every long rest” to reach 16 AC; “if you can also equip a shield, you’ll reach 18 AC.”
    - Gameplay revolves around “Magic Missile for single-target damage, Chromatic Orb for some area damage, Sleep and Thunderwave for crowd control.”
    - Early priorities listed: “If human or Half-Elf, find and equip a shield”; “Quarterstaff with a free spell like Crones or Melf’s”; “Supplies for camps, alchemy material, and scrolls”; “Consume scrolls that have useful spells to learn them”; “Exchange spells and experiment…”

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Transmutation School
  - Spells: Grease, Find Familiar
  - Subclass Feature: Experimental Alchemy
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Sleep
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use crowd control and area setup (Grease can combine with Fire Bolt to ignite a large area and “knock prone enemies”).
    - Turn 2+: Use existing single-target and crowd control toolkit as needed.
  - Notes:
    - Grease + Fire Bolt interaction is called out as helpful for area fire and prone.
    - Find Familiar is described as utility where “a small critter can enter areas your main character cannot.”
    - Experimental Alchemy: “isn’t that helpful, due to the high 15 DC to craft another potion.”

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Spells: Flaming Sphere, Hold Person
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Hold Person
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Flaming Sphere (summon) for damage and soaking hits (it “acts as a decoy and damage dealer”).
    - Turn 2+: Use Hold Person for crowd control; adjust prepared spells as Sleep becomes less effective.
  - Notes:
    - Hold Person is described as powerful CC; “Sleep becomes less and less effective due to increased hit points.”
    - The guide suggests “dropping Sleep and preparing both Hold Person and Flaming Sphere.”

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Cantrip: Minor Illusion
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (Intelligence +2)
  - Spells: Misty Step, Scorching Ray
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Hold Person
  - Misty Step
  - Scorching Ray
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use mobility if needed (Misty Step is a “bonus action mobility tool”).
    - Turn 2+: Use ranged damage (Scorching Ray) and your established CC/damage options.
  - Notes:
    - “Always keep a level 2 spell slot ready” for Misty Step.

  - Mage Armour
  - Magic Missile
  - Thunderwave
  - Flaming Sphere
  - Hold Person
  - Misty Step
  - Scorching Ray
  - Counterspell
  - Fireball
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: “Pick up Fireball and use it early in fights,” especially when enemies are “often clumped together at the start.”
    - Turn 2+: “Once you’ve cast Fireball, you can move on to single-target spells.”
  - Notes:
    - Counterspell: “incredibly helpful in avoiding crowd control spells like Hold Person.”
    - Friendly fire warning: area spells can hit allies; “be careful targeting friendlies.”

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Subclass Feature: Transmuter’s Stone
  - Spells: Haste, Enlarge/Reduce

  - Misty Step
  - Counterspell
  - Fireball
  - Hold Person
  - Haste

    - Turn 2+: Use Haste and Enlarge/Reduce as utility buffs depending on fight needs.
  - Notes:
    - Transmuter’s Stone is a “long-term buff you can use per long rest”; you can “recharge… by casting a level 1 or higher Transmutation spell.”
    - Haste requires concentration; if it breaks, it causes “lethargic… which will skip one turn.”
    - “Ending Act 1 with a Transmutation Wizard” notes: check traders; stock up on camp and alchemy supplies; look over Act 1 items; don’t miss Act 1 permanent bonuses; Grymforge has “powerful armor and weapons (Adamantine)” and “you won’t be able to come back to this map.”

  - Notes:

    - “You only get one level 6 spell slot unless you have one of the two most powerful quarterstaffs in the game: the Staff of Spellpower or Markoheshkir.”
    - These staves provide a “free cast of a level 6 spell,” allowing “two spells per long rest rather than one.”

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Pre-Buff: Always cast Mage Armour following a long rest to maintain 16 or higher AC.
2. Bonus Action: Don’t forget your bonus action for a potion or Misty Step.
3. Use Environment: Combine a fire spell with Grease and coat the area with fire damage or water and electrical,
4. Knockback: Combine a big knockback with Misty Step and create distance whenever you can to survive.
5. Area Damage: Don’t hit allies with friendly fire and point or aim your spells to avoid allies.
6. Rest Constantly: Your spell slots will quickly run out after one or more fights, especially if challenging.
7. Positioning: Look to move back in distance and even use Hide to prevent damage from coming in.
8. Crowd Control: Make sure you focus on taking out the primary target with Sleep, Hold Person, or any other CC to limit potential damage.
9. Big Nuke: Typically, you want to fire off your big spells early to finish off targets before they can attack you.
10. Use Consumables: One of the best early consumables is the Potion of Speed for two actions per turn.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative Transmutation Build Melee Wizard (Bladesinging multiclass route from the guide):
  - Level 1: Wizard — Cantrips: Fire Bolt, Booming Blade, Bursting Sinew, Friends; Spells: Longstrider, Shield, Thunderwave, Magic Missile
  - Level 2: Wizard — Subclass: Bladesinging; False Life; Feather Fall

  - Level 5: Wizard — Fireball; Counterspell

  - Level 10: Fighter — Action Surge
  - Level 11: Fighter — Subclass: Champion
  - Level 12: Fighter — Feat: Alert
- Guide note: This route is “an alternative melee focused Wizard build,” giving “incredible melee damage and movement” but requires multiclassing and is “more complexity and gear specific items.”

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- “The most important change to the Wizard is the addition of Bladesinging subclass and Booming Blade Cantrip.”
- This “allows the Wizard to play effectively in melee range.”
- “The downside however is losing out on more spellcasting potential of the Transmutation subclass.”
- “Additionally, the Wizard can use the Hexblade subclass one level to start and gain many proficiencies that can aid in combat… many more options for dealing with combat.”
