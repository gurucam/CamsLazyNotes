## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **dark caster** who leans into life-and-death magic: you sap foes, raise the dead, and turn the battlefield into your personal graveyard.
- The combat identity is “**one wizard, many bodies**”—you multiply your presence through summons so you’re not limited to one action’s worth of impact each round.
- You play from safety: let allies + summons engage up front while you apply ranged damage, control, and big area pressure.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Build a frontline of disposable bodies and play behind it, using ranged damage and control to win fights safely and steadily.**

### Party role
- **Backline DPS:** consistent ranged damage while conserving resources when needed.
- **Summon engine:** undead and elemental bodies add pressure, soak hits, and create space for your party.
- **Utility + control:** teleporting reposition, knockback, and area spells to manage threats.

### Pros
- Very fun “**necromancer fantasy**” with multiple undead/elementals on the battlefield at a time
- Strong survivability plan for a robe caster: Dexterity + Mage Armour, plus defensive spells and positioning
- Scales well as spell slots increase and summons become more powerful

### Cons
- Starts slow: you won’t pick your subclass until level 2, and the “necromancer feel” really arrives later
- Spell-slot management matters: you can run dry if you over-nuke every encounter
- Friendly-fire risk with area spells if positioning gets sloppy

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Misty Step** + better slot count (early survivability + flexibility)
- Level 4: **Spell Sniper** (Eldritch Blast) for strong cantrip damage when you want to conserve slots
- Level 6: **Animate Dead** becomes always-prepared + **Undead Thralls** (the build starts to feel like a Necromancer)
- Level 9–10: larger summons and stronger spell levels (endgame power ramps)

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** High Half-Elf
- **Class:** Wizard
- **Subclass:** Necromancy School
- **Background:** Sage
- **Skills:** Investigation, Religion
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 14 / INT 16 / WIS 10 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why High Half-Elf)
- The race recommendation emphasizes **Fey Ancestry**, **Darkvision**, and **Shield Proficiency**.
- The guide calls out that **shield proficiency is key** for equipping optimal gear with this necromancy subclass.

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **Human** (increased carrying capacity, skill proficiency, and shield proficiency).

## Level-by-level progression (Wizard 1 → 12)

### Level 1 — Wizard 1
**Gain**
- **Cantrips:** Fire Bolt, Bone Chill, Blade Ward
- **Spells (learned):** Mage Armour, Magic Missile, Shield, Sleep, Thunderwave, Chromatic Orb
- **Prepared spells (suggested):** (the guide notes you have four prepared spells at level 1)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Start fights at range and keep spacing; you’re fragile early, so treat positioning as your first “defensive stat.”
- Use **Mage Armour** after long rest / before adventuring, and lean on **Sleep** to remove early threats quickly.
- When melee pressure closes in, **Thunderwave** is your “get off me” button (and can enable ledge kills).

### Level 2 — Wizard 2
**Gain**
- **Subclass:** Necromancy School
- **Subclass feature:** Necromancy Savant (Level 2)
- **Subclass feature:** Grim Harvest (Level 2)
- **Spells (learned):** Ice Knife, Find Familiar
- **Prepared spells (suggested):** Mage Armour, Sleep, Magic Missile, Chromatic Orb, Thunderwave

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Use **Chromatic Orb** as your single-target elemental damage option (the guide notes cold is a common pick for prone).
- **Ice Knife** gives you ranged splash damage and can leave an ice surface—good for control through prone.
- Keep **Thunderwave** ready for emergency knockback; knock enemies away, then reposition if needed.

### Level 3 — Wizard 3
**Gain**
- **Spells (learned):** Misty Step, Flaming Sphere
- **Prepared spells (suggested):** Mage Armour, Misty Step, Flaming Sphere, Magic Missile, Chromatic Orb, Thunderwave

**Play style (Level 3)**
- **Misty Step** is the “get away” tool—bonus action teleport so you can still spend your action on offense.
- **Flaming Sphere** is your early “summon”: use it as a decoy and steady damage, but remember it’s concentration.
- Avoid running two concentration effects; if survival is rough, the guide suggests swapping **Thunderwave** for **Shield**.

### Level 4 — Wizard 4
**Gain**
- **Cantrip (learned):** Mage Hand
- **Spells (learned):** Scorching Ray, Mirror Image
- **Feat:** Spell Sniper
  - **Cantrip (from feat):** Eldritch Blast

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Your core slot-saver is now **Eldritch Blast**: strong damage when you’re low/exhausted on spell slots.
- **Mirror Image** is the “god-tier defensive” option if you’re dying repeatedly—pair it with Mage Armour for staying power.
- **Scorching Ray** fills the “multi-hit burst” role: focus-fire one target or split rays to finish multiple enemies.

### Level 5 — Wizard 5
**Gain**
- **Spells (learned):** Fireball, Animate Dead
- **Prepared spells (suggested):** Mage Armour, Misty Step, Flaming Sphere, Chromatic Orb, Thunderwave, Scorching Ray, Animate Dead

**Play style (Level 5)**
- **Fireball** becomes your main area damage tool—use it early when the enemy clumps, but be careful not to include allies.
- Start leaning harder into the necromancer theme with **Animate Dead** when corpses are available.
- Keep a level 2 slot in reserve for **Misty Step** when fights get messy; don’t spend every slot on nukes.

### Level 6 — Wizard 6
**Gain**
- **Subclass feature:** Undead Thralls: Additional Undead (Level 6)
- **Subclass feature:** Undead Thralls: Better Summons (Level 6)
- **Always prepared:** Animate Dead (the guide notes this becomes “always prepared”)
- **Spells (learned):** Haste, Glyph of Warding
- **Prepared spells (suggested):** Mage Armour, Misty Step, Flaming Sphere, Chromatic Orb, Thunderwave, Scorching Ray, Fireball, Haste

**Play style (Level 6)**
- This is the “feel like a Necromancer” level: **Undead Thralls** makes summons much stronger and raises an additional corpse.
- If you’re using **Haste**, treat it as a high-impact concentration choice—either accelerate an ally’s offense or empower your tempo.
- **Glyph of Warding** is presented as a flex spell; you can swap it depending on what you need per fight.

### Level 7 — Wizard 7
**Gain**
- **Spells (learned):** Blight, Conjure Minor Elemental
- **Prepared spells (suggested):** Mage Armour, Misty Step, Fireball, Scorching Ray, Conjure Minor Elemental, Animate Dead, Haste, Blight

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Start fights by deciding your “concentration plan”: **Haste** vs **Conjure Minor Elemental** based on encounter tempo.
- Use **Blight** as a powerful necrotic-themed damage option when you want heavy single-target pressure.
- Let summons occupy space and take hits while you stay safe, repositioning with **Misty Step** as needed.

### Level 8 — Wizard 8
**Gain**
- **Feat:** Ability Improvement (+2 Intelligence)
- **Spells (learned):** Conjure Minor Elemental, Ice Storm
- **Prepared spells (suggested):** Mage Armour, Misty Step, Fireball, Scorching Ray, Conjure Minor Elemental, Animate Dead, Haste, Blight, Ice Storm

**Play style (Level 8)**
- With higher Intelligence, prioritize landing your key spells reliably; your turn quality improves through better hit chance.
- **Ice Storm** gives you area pressure and terrain control—use it when you want to slow/knock down groups while summons engage.
- Continue to treat concentration as your “one big choice” each fight: summon-based pressure or Haste-based tempo.

### Level 9 — Wizard 9
**Gain**
- **Cantrip (learned):** Shocking Grasp
- **Spells (learned):** Banishment, Blight
- **Prepared spells (suggested):** Mage Armour, Misty Step, Fireball, Scorching Ray, Conjure Minor Elemental, Animate Dead, Haste, Blight, Ice Storm

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Use **Banishment** as a high-value control option when removing one enemy swings the fight.
- **Shocking Grasp** is your melee “escape” cantrip: it supports disengaging when something reaches your backline.
- Keep the core loop: bodies up front (undead/elementals), you behind them, controlling spacing with movement and spells.

### Level 10 — Wizard 10
**Gain**
- **Subclass feature:** Inured to Undeath (Level 10)
- **Spells (learned):** Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold

**Play style (Level 10)**
- You become more durable against necrotic threats: **Resistant to Necrotic damage**, and your hit point maximum cannot be reduced.
- **Conjure Elemental** is a major summon upgrade—use it for long fights where extra bodies win the resource war.
- **Cone of Cold** becomes a premium “close-range nuke” if enemies push into your space (position carefully).

### Level 11 — Wizard 11
**Gain**
- **Cantrip (learned):** Toll of the Dead
- **Spells (learned):** Hold Monster, Confusion

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Use **Hold Monster** when you need a single target to stop acting; it’s a fight-shaping control button.
- **Confusion** adds chaotic control for clustered encounters—cast it when enemy turns matter more than raw damage.
- You’re now a full backline controller/DPS with summon support: decide each fight if you win by damage, disables, or both.

### Level 12 — Wizard 12
**Gain**
- **Feat:** Ability Improvement (+2 Intelligence)
- **Spells (learned):** Disintegration, Globe of Invulnerability, Arcane Gate

**Play style (Level 12)**
- **Globe of Invulnerability** is your “nope” button for dangerous turns—use it to stabilize fights or protect the party during spikes.
- **Disintegration** is your high-end single-target finisher when something must die now.
- **Arcane Gate** enables repositioning plays for the whole party; use it to control engagement ranges and reset bad positions.

# Best consumables / items (single-use)
- **Elixir of Bloodlust**
  - Once per turn when you kill a foe, you gain **5 temporary hit points** and an **additional action**.
  - Strong when fights snowball: use it when you expect kills (adds tempo without spending spell slots).
- **Potion of Speed**
  - **3 turns** of an increased action via the **Haste** condition.
  - Use on boss turns or hard encounters when you need “more actions now.”
- **Potion of Angelic Slumber**

  - Best used when you can safely remove your character from danger to reset resources mid-adventuring day.
- **Potion of Invisibility**

  - Use to reposition safely, escape pressure, or start fights on your terms.
- **Potion of Flying**
  - **10 turns** of flying.
  - Use to control range, reach high ground, and avoid being pinned by melee.
- **Elixir of Peerless Focus**
  - Gain advantage on **concentration saves** (ingredients Sublimate of Belladona, and any ashes).
  - Use when you expect to maintain a key concentration spell through incoming damage.
- **Elixir of Vigilance**
  - Gain **+5 bonus initiative** and you cannot be surprised (ingredients sublimate of bloodstained hook, any ashes).
  - Use when going first matters (opening control/damage before enemies act).
- **Superior Elixir of Arcane Cultivation**
  - Gain a **level 3 spell slot** (ingredients Solution of Night Orchid, any Vitriol).
  - Use when you want more mid-tier casting without resting.

---

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
- **Mind Blast**
  - Spew forth a conical wave of psychic energy and possibly stun targets within for **1 turn** dealing psychic damage.
  - This is an extremely powerful conal stun that the Mindflayer uses in the prologue.
- **Freecast**
  - Spell slots, charges, and similar resource costs for your next action or spell are removed.
  - Refreshes after a Short or Long rest.
  - This helps cast two spells in one turn rather than one.
- **Repulsor**
  - Massive area knockback that can hit friendlies.
- **Charm**
  - This is the priority power you want to obtain because you can force enemies to attack something else.

---

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- **Warlock (Hexblade) 1 → Wizard (Evocation) 11**
  - Start at Level 1 as a Hexblade Warlock.
  - This grants early access to Eldritch Blast and Booming Blade, plus proficiencies in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons, greatly improving early-game durability.
  - If you want to stick with robes, make sure to take Mage Armour at Wizard Level 3 for extra defense.
  - While the focus is on Necromancy as the main build, here we recommend Evocation instead for better synergy with offensive cantrips and AoE spells.
  - You’ll miss out on a Level 12 feat due to multiclassing, but the early damage boost, improved survivability, and long-term cantrip scaling make this hybrid build both powerful and reliable.
