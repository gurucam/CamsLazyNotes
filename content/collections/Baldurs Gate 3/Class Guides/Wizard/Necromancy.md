    - Flaming Sphere is concentration; be careful to not use two concentration spells.
    - If you struggle with survival drop Thunderwave for Shield.

  - Feat: Spell Sniper (Eldritch Blast)

  - Flaming Sphere
  - Magic Missile
  - Chromatic Orb
  - Thunderwave
  - Scorching Ray
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:

    - Spell Sniper: you learn a cantrip and the number you need to roll a Critical Hit while attacking with a Spell is reduced by 1 (can stack).
    - Eldritch Blast: 1d10 force damage via an 18-meter beam; used primarily for damage when low or exhausted on spell slots.
    - Elemental Adept is a good feat option if you plan on leaning into fire or cold spells.

  - Chromatic Orb
  - Thunderwave
  - Scorching Ray
  - Animate Dead
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
  - Notes:
    - Fireball: “mega” spell with massive damage in a large radius; make sure the area is clear or target a spot on the ground that won’t impact your allies.
    - Animate Dead: Create an undead servant from a corpse (Medium or Small corpse).
      - When you summon an undead you can pick Zombie (melee) or Skelton (ranged).
      - Pick depending on group composition (heavy melee, pick range, and so on).
      - Lasts until a long rest; summon right away after a long rest and use it the entire time.

    - Glyph of Warding: AoE damage trap and spell; weaker than Fireball; consider a flex option.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Pre-Buff: Always cast Mage Armour following a long rest. This will keep you alive and oftentimes you will forget it falls off.
2. Bonus Action: Use bonus action for potions, jumps, or limited spells.
3. Environment: Combine Grease with a fire spell and coat the area with fire damage or water with Lighting damage.
4. Knockback: Having a spell-like Thunderwave is essential to handling pressure from enemies.
5. Area Damage: Use Fireball and area damage spells, but be sure not to include allies or they will take damage.
6. Rest Constantly: Resting and using resources is a small-time commitment, but it’s the difference between life and death when you enter combat.
7. Positioning: Keeping your distance and casting spells from as far as possible to avoid melee pressure.
8. Crowd Control: Focus on taking out the primary target with Sleep, Hold Person, or any other CC to limit potential damage.
9. Big Nuke: Use mega damage spells early and often, but save at least one level 2 spell slot for Misty Step.
10. Use Consumables: Use the Potion of Speed when you need an extra action in combat.

## Alternative Build Route
- Start at Level 1 as a Hexblade Warlock:
  - Grants early access to Eldritch Blast and Booming Blade, plus proficiencies in medium armor, shields, and martial weapons, improving early-game durability.
  - If you want to stick with robes, take Mage Armour at Wizard Level 3 for extra defense.
- While the focus is on Necromancy as the main build, this alternative recommends Evocation “instead for better synergy with offensive cantrips and AoE spells.”
- You’ll miss out on a Level 12 feat due to multiclassing.

Level / Class / Selection
- 1 Warlock: Subclass: Hexblade, Eldritch Blast, Booming Blade, Hex, Shield
- 2 Wizard: Firebolt, Mage Hand, Friends, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile, Longstrider, Shield, Thunderwave, Find Familiar
- 3 Wizard: Subclass: Evocation, Mage Armour, Protection from Good and Evil
- 4 Wizard: Misty Step, Scorching Ray
- 5 Wizard: Bursting Sinew, Mirror Image, Blur, Feat: +2 Intelligence
- 6 Wizard: Fireball, Counterspell
- 7 Wizard: Haste, Glyph of Warding
- 8 Wizard: Conjure Minor Elemental, Ice Storm
- 9 Wizard: Banishment, Blight, Shocking Grasp, Feat: Spell Sniper
- 10 Wizard: Conjure Elemental, Cone of Cold
- 11 Wizard: Toll of the Dead, Hold Monster, Confusion
- 12 Wizard: Disintegration, Globe of Invulnerability

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 reshapes the Wizard class with the Bladesinging subclass and Booming Blade cantrip, turning Wizards into agile melee duelists.
- Bladesinging boosts AC and mobility, while Booming Blade adds scaling melee damage.
- “However, this does come at the cost of some traditional spellcasting depth.”
- For a stronger start and added versatility: a one-level dip into Hexblade Warlock grants armor, weapon proficiencies, and Eldritch Blast; improves early survivability and damage.
- “While you’ll lose a Level 12 feat, the trade-off delivers a well-rounded, fun hybrid playstyle.”

### Patch 7
- “The Necromancy Wizard remains untouched in Patch 7 for Baldur’s Gate 3.”
- “Expect the same gameplay and combat style with new cinematics, ending, and honor mode tweaks.”
- “Larian Studios’ main focus in this patch is mods.”
- “The game now features a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager, allowing players to create and install mods directly within the game.”
- “This best Necromancy Wizard build guide remains unchanged for Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 7.”
