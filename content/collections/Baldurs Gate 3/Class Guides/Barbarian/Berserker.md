## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain: Unarmored Defense; Rage
- Play Style: Use bonus action to Rage on your first turn and charge in; attack each turn (melee or ranged) to keep Rage active. You can use medium armour or clothing, and a two-handed weapon.

### Level 2
- Gain: Reckless Attack; Danger Sense
- Play Style: Rage on the first turn, charge into combat, and use Reckless Attack for the majority of your attacks; keep a bow equipped in case you cannot reach a target on your first turn.

### Level 3
- Gain: Subclass: Berserker; Extra Rage Charge; Frenzy (Rage turns into Frenzy); Frenzied Strike; Enraged Throw
- Play Style: Use your bonus action to enter Frenzy on the first turn and charge in; on following turns, attack with your action and use a bonus action attack/throw as needed (the guide warns that using bonus action attacks every turn can knock you out of Frenzy, so “Limit it if possible”).

### Level 4
- Gain: Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Strength; increase Strength to 18)
- Play Style: No major gameplay change; increased Strength helps consistent damage and chance to hit.

### Level 5
- Gain: Extra Attack; Fast Movement (+5 movement while not wearing heavy armor)
- Play Style: Extra Attack paired with Frenzied Strike allows multiple attacks per turn; the guide calls this where the Barbarian “starts to dominate.”

### Level 6
- Gain: Additional Rage charge; Mindless Rage
- Play Style: More of the same in combat; Mindless Rage prevents being Charmed or Frightened while Frenzied and Calm Emotions no longer ends your rage.

### Level 7
- Gain: Feral Instinct (+3 Initiative; can’t be surprised)
- Play Style: High Initiative and can’t be surprised helps you act early to stun or eliminate a priority target and reduce damage for you and your team.

### Level 8
- Gain: Feat: Great Weapon Master
- Play Style: The guide recommends initiating combat using your action first and saving your bonus action for Great Weapon Master’s bonus-action attack after a kill/critical; use other bonus action attacks if you must stun a target or you don’t proc the effect.

### Level 9
- Gain: Brutal Critical
- Play Style: Simple beyond this level; Brutal Critical is a passive feature that adds more damage on critical hits.

### Level 10
- Gain: Intimidating Presence
- Play Style: Action-based fear; the guide notes it’s an “odd skill” and they “don’t use much.”

### Level 11
- Gain: Multi-class Fighter (recommended); Great Weapon Fighting Style; Second Wind
- Play Style: The guide recommends spending the last two levels multi-classing to Fighter “purely for Action Surge.”

### Level 12
- Gain: Fighter Action Surge
- Play Style: Action Surge gives you an extra action (once-per-fight usage; recharges on short rest); with Extra Attack, this means more attacks per turn (the guide also mentions you can take Barbarian to 12 instead for Ability Improvement +2 Strength or Alert).
