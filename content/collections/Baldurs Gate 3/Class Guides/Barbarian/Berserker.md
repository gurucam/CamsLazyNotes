## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A classic **frontline berserker**: you Rage into **Frenzy**, swing a two-hander, and use bonus actions to keep the pressure on.
- Plays like “**get in, delete the priority target, and snowball**”—your damage spikes hard once Extra Attack and Great Weapon Master come online.
- You still have a ranged plan: **Enraged Throw** lets you knock targets Prone and keep Rage active when you can’t reach something.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Frenzy → Reckless Attack → stack extra attacks** (Extra Attack, bonus-action attacks, Speed/Haste, Action Surge) to end fights before enemies stabilize.

### Party role
- **Frontline bruiser:** high threat, high damage, soaks pressure with Rage resistances.
- **Burst finisher:** turns kills/crits into more attacks (especially once Great Weapon Master is online).
- **Control by force:** Enraged Throw (Prone) + positioning to disrupt casters/archers.

### Pros
- Extremely high **melee DPR** and excellent mid-game spikes
- Simple, consistent loop that scales with consumables
- Great “go first, delete one target” gameplay once Initiative improves

### Cons
- Can be punished when overextended (melee range + Reckless trade-off)
- Less utility than caster-heavy comps (you rely on gear/consumables/party)
- Magic-heavy encounters can feel rough without support

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Frenzy** + **Frenzied Strike / Enraged Throw**
- Level 5: **Extra Attack** (your turn count explodes)
- Level 8: **Great Weapon Master** (kills/crits → more attacks)
- Level 12: **Action Surge** (burst turns become absurd)

---

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Half-Orc
- **Class:** Barbarian
- **Subclass:** Berserker
- **Background:** Soldier
- **Skills:** Survival, Perception
- **Abilities (target):** STR 16 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 8 / WIS 10 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Half-Orc)
- **Relentless Endurance** (survivability “fail-safe” when you’d drop)
- **Savage Attacks** (extra damage on crits—great with your crit/kill snowball turns)
- **Darkvision** (quality-of-life)

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **Duergar Dwarf** (Enlarge + Invisibility for damage/utility).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** two-handed Greatsword early (the guide highlights **Everburn Blade** as a strong prologue pickup).
- **Armor vs clothing:** you can run medium armour *or* clothing—just be mindful of item interactions (e.g., **Bracers of Defence** only work when not wearing armour).
- **Back-bar ranged:** keep a ranged weapon equipped so you can always attack to maintain Rage/Frenzy when movement is limited.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Complete the prologue, recruit companions, and stabilize your early economy (sell/stock up).
- Push to **Level 5** quickly (Extra Attack).
- Reach the **Underdark / Grymforge** and consider crafting **Adamantine** gear that can last deep into the game.

## Level-by-level progression (Barbarian 1 → 10, Fighter 1 → 2)
> This build is very “turn-plan” driven. Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop.

### Level 1 — Barbarian 1
**Gain**
- **Unarmoured Defence** (AC = 10 + DEX mod + CON mod while not wearing armour; shields still work)
- **Rage** (bonus damage + physical resistances; keep it active by attacking or taking damage)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Open with **Rage/Frenzy** as your bonus action in real fights, then close distance and hit hard.
- Keep a ranged weapon equipped so you can always attack once per turn to maintain Rage.

### Level 2 — Barbarian 2
**Gain**
- **Reckless Attack** (Advantage on melee attacks, but enemies also get Advantage against you)
- **Danger Sense** (better DEX saves vs traps/spells you can see)

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Reckless is your default damage button—use it most when you can safely trade the defensive downside.
- Pick targets you can delete quickly so the “advantage against you” doesn’t matter.

### Level 3 — Barbarian 3 (Berserker)
**Subclass**
- **Berserker**

**Gain**
- **Frenzy** (your Rage upgrade for this build)
- **Frenzied Strike** (bonus-action melee attack with your weapon)
- **Enraged Throw** (pick up an item/creature, throw it for Bludgeoning damage + **Prone**)
- Extra Rage charge

**Play style (Level 3)**
- The build “turns on” here: use bonus actions aggressively (Frenzied Strike) once Frenzy is active.
- Use **Enraged Throw** when you need control or can’t close distance—Prone is huge and it keeps tempo.

### Level 4 — Barbarian 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Strength** (the guide recommends pushing STR to **18** here)

**Play style (Level 4)**
- You hit harder and miss less—no major loop change yet.
- The guide delays Great Weapon Master until later because your bonus action is already very valuable at this stage.

### Level 5 — Barbarian 5
**Gain**
- **Extra Attack** (two attacks per Attack action)
- **Fast Movement** (+5 movement speed while not wearing heavy armour)

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Your baseline turn becomes: **Frenzy → Reckless Attack → Extra Attack → bonus-action attack** (often 3 hits/turn).
- For hard fights, **Potion of Speed** adds another action (more attacks), letting you burst down priority targets immediately.

### Level 6 — Barbarian 6
**Gain**
- **Mindless Rage** (while Frenzied: can’t be Charmed or Frightened; Calm Emotions no longer ends your Rage)
- Extra Rage charge

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Same damage loop, but you’re much harder to shut down by common control effects.
- Before leaving Act 1, the guide recommends checking vendors, stocking supplies, and considering **Grymforge / Adamantine** crafting.

### Level 7 — Barbarian 7
**Gain**
- **Feral Instinct** (+3 Initiative; can’t be Surprised)

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Going early is a real power increase: you can delete or disable the highest priority target before it acts.

### Level 8 — Barbarian 8
**Feat**
- **Great Weapon Master** (toggleable -5 to hit / +10 damage; also bonus-action attack on kill/crit)

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Treat the -5/+10 as a **toggle**: turn it off when hit chance is low; turn it on when you have Advantage and good accuracy.
- Big shift: if you expect a kill/crit, **start with your action attacks** and save your bonus action for the Great Weapon Master follow-up.
- If you don’t proc kill/crit, you still have Frenzied Strike / Enraged Throw as backup bonus-action pressure.

### Level 9 — Barbarian 9
**Gain**
- **Brutal Critical** (extra damage die on crits)

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Passive spike—your crits get scarier, which feeds Great Weapon Master snowball turns.

### Level 10 — Barbarian 10
**Gain**
- **Intimidating Presence** (action-based Fear; if resisted, can’t re-target until Long Rest)

**Play style (Level 10)**
- The guide notes this isn’t a core part of the loop (you’re usually better off just attacking).
- Use it situationally if you need Fear and don’t have a better action.

### Level 11 — Fighter 1
**Multiclass**
- **Fighter 1** (recommended by the guide for endgame burst)

**Gain**
- **Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting** (reroll 1s/2s on two-handed weapon damage dice)
- **Second Wind** (bonus-action heal)

**Play style (Level 11)**
- This level sets up **Action Surge** next—combat loop stays the same, but your damage consistency improves.
- The guide’s reasoning: Action Surge’s extra action is worth more than a pure Barbarian’s late bonuses for this build’s burst plan.

### Level 12 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- **Action Surge** (extra action; recharges on Short Rest)

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Your burst math (from the guide):
  - Attack action (2 attacks) = 2
  - Action Surge (2 attacks) = 4
  - Haste/Speed action (2 attacks) = 6
  - Great Weapon Master bonus attack (kill/crit) = 7
- This is the endgame identity: stack actions and erase the biggest threat immediately.
