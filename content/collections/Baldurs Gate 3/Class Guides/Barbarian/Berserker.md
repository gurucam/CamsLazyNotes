### Party Role
- Melee damage dealer that “deal[s] a lot of damage in a short amount of time.”
- Durable front-liner with Resistance to physical damage while raging.
- Utility/control from Enraged Throw (can knock targets Prone).

### Pros

- Extra Attacks

### Cons

- Weak Range
- Vulnerable to Magic

### Power Spikes
- Level 3: “The Berserker Barbarian BG3 build starts to feel powerful at level 3.”
- Level 5: “This is where the Barbarian starts to dominate.”
- Level 12 (with Fighter multiclass): Action Surge + Extra Attack + Great Weapon Master = “so much firepower.”

## Character Creation
- Race: Half-Orc
- Subrace: (Not specified in source)
- Class: Barbarian
- Subclass: Berserker
- Background: Soldier
- Ability Scores: Strength 16, Dexterity 14, Constitution 16, Intelligence 8, Wisdom 10, Charisma 10
- Proficiencies:
  - Background (Soldier): Athletics, Intimidation
  - Skills (recommended): Perception, Survival

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Unarmored Defense
  - Rage
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Rage as a bonus action; “charge into combat to either strike melee or at range.”
    - Turn 2+: Keep Rage active by attacking or taking damage each turn.
  - Notes:
    - Rage ends early if you don’t attack an enemy or take damage each turn; you can’t cast or concentrate on spells while raging.
    - Unarmored Defense: AC = 10 + DEX modifier + CON modifier (you can use a shield and still gain the benefit).
    - You can use medium armour or clothing; the guide notes risk/reward with clothing-based gear sets (Wrath status effect) later.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Reckless Attack
  - Danger Sense
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage; “charge into combat.”
    - Turn 2+: Use Reckless Attack for the majority of your attacks.
  - Notes:
    - Reckless Attack: Advantage on melee weapon attack rolls; enemies also gain Advantage against you until your next turn (recommended vs an enemy you will kill or that won’t target you next turn).
    - Danger Sense: Advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws against traps, spells, and surfaces (passive).
    - “Make sure to equip a bow in case you cannot reach a target on your first turn.”

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Berserker
  - Extra Rage Charge
  - Frenzied Strike (bonus action melee attack)
  - Enraged Throw (throw an item/creature; can knock target Prone)
  - Frenzy (enter a frenzied rage as a bonus action; allows an additional melee weapon attack on each of your turns; incurs “one level of exhaustion once your rage ends”)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Frenzy; “charge into combat to either strike melee or at range.”
    - Turn 2+: Use your action first (Reckless), then a bonus action attack (Frenzied Strike or Enraged Throw).
  - Notes:
    - Enraged Throw is highlighted as essential utility: it can “stun or knock an enemy prone.”
    - The guide warns: using Frenzied Strike / Enraged Throw every turn can knock you out of Frenzy — “Limit it if possible.”

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Strength; “increase your strength to 18”)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage/Frenzy; close distance; attack.
    - Turn 2+: Continue attacking; use bonus-action attacks/throws as needed.
  - Notes:
    - The guide does not recommend Great Weapon Master at this level (Berserker makes strong use of bonus actions via Frenzied Strike / Enraged Throw).

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Extra Attack
  - Fast Movement (+5 movement speed while not wearing heavy armor)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage/Frenzy; charge in with Reckless Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Action attacks (Extra Attack) + bonus action strike/throw (paired with Frenzied Strike) for multiple attacks per turn.
  - Notes:
    - “At level 5 the Barbarian becomes amazing with Extra Attack paired with Frenized Strike.”
    - “This is where the Barbarian starts to dominate.”
    - Potion of Speed is called out as a way to “do a lot of damage in one turn.”

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Additional Rage charge
  - Mindless Rage (while Frenzied: can’t be Charmed or Frightened; Calm Emotions no longer ends your rage)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage/Frenzy; engage.
    - Turn 2+: Keep Rage/Frenzy active; continue action attacks with bonus-action utility as needed.
  - Notes:
    - Mindless Rage is described as your rage becoming “all-consuming, repelling outside influence.”

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Feral Instinct (+3 Initiative; can’t be surprised)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Act early due to Initiative; engage to keep Rage active.
    - Turn 2+: Maintain pressure; focus on “stunning or eliminating the highest priority” threats.
  - Notes:
    - The guide emphasizes acting in round one and avoiding the Surprised condition.

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Feat: Great Weapon Master
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Start combat using your action first; keep your bonus action available.
    - Turn 2+: Use the Great Weapon Master bonus-action attack after a critical hit or kill (otherwise use Frenzied Strike / Enraged Throw when needed).
  - Notes:
    - Great Weapon Master is described as “high risk reward.” The guide recommends saving your bonus action for the feat’s proc when possible.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Brutal Critical (on a Critical Hit, roll an extra damage die)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage/Frenzy; engage.
    - Turn 2+: Continue normal attack pattern; Brutal Critical is passive.
  - Notes:
    - (No additional playstyle notes beyond the passive feature.)

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Intimidating Presence (action-based; instills Fear)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage/Frenzy; engage.
    - Turn 2+: Use Intimidating Presence as needed; otherwise continue attacks.
  - Notes:
    - The guide calls it an “odd skill” and notes they “don’t use much.”

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Option (stay Barbarian): Relentless Rage (drop to 0 HP → have 1 HP instead of being Downed)
  - Option (multiclass Fighter): Great Weapon Fighting Style; Second Wind
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage/Frenzy; engage.
    - Turn 2+: Continue normal attacks; multiclass is recommended “purely for Action Surge.”
  - Notes:
    - The guide recommends Fighter multiclassing here because Barbarian levels 11–12 “doesn’t get much,” and Action Surge is the goal.
    - Great Weapon Fighting Style rerolls 1s/2s on damage dice for two-handed melee attacks.
    - Second Wind is a bonus-action heal.

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - If multiclass Fighter 2: Action Surge (extra action; recharges on short rest)
  - If stay Barbarian: Ability Improvement (+2 Strength) or Alert feat (mentioned as alternatives)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Rage/Frenzy; engage.
    - Turn 2+: Use Action Surge in key fights to gain another action (with Extra Attack, this creates “2x more attacks”).
  - Notes:
    - The guide describes stacking Action Surge with Potion of Haste / Haste for even more actions, and notes Great Weapon Master can add another bonus-action attack on a critical hit or kill (if you have a bonus action).

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Use Rage Wisely: Activate this and stay aggressive; you need to either do damage or be damaged.
- Initial Turn: Make sure your initial move puts you in melee range so you can strike, or attack with range to keep Rage active.
- Bonus Action: Once you get Frenzied Strike, you can attack with a bonus action — don’t waste it.
- Prioritize melee combat: Use different weapons based on their strength and unique skills, like Cleave for Area damage.
- Manage Frenzy: Make sure you have at least two charges left on your Frenzy so you can re-acquire it during a long fight if you lose the buff.
- Reckless Attack: Use this attack when it’s likely you will not receive a return blow.
- Potion of Speed: Use these potions to gain bigger movement and more actions in challenging fights.
- Enraged Throw: Useful when you need to keep Rage or Frenzy active but don’t have the movement.
- Long Rest: Rest when your Rage and Frenzy counters are low so you start with many available.
- Great Weapon Master: Target low-health enemies with a high chance to hit so you can proc a free extra attack if you kill them.
- Party note (companions): The guide does not recommend adding additional front-line fighters/damage dealers; it lists Shadowheart (Cleric), Gale (Wizard), and Astarion (Rogue) as companions and notes their roles.

## Alternative Build Route
- “Alternative Berserker Barbarian Build”: a Throw build using the Giant subclass (described as “one of the best alternatives”).
- The build “comes together around Barbarian level 6” with Elemental Cleaver, and is paired with the Tavern Brawler feat for very hard-hitting throws.
- It “performs well across all three Acts,” offering “consistent damage output with better survivability at range,” but “doesn’t quite match the raw melee burst” of traditional Barbarian paths.
- Leveling outline (as listed):
  - 1 Barbarian: Unarmored Defense, Rage
  - 2 Barbarian: Reckless Attack, Danger Sense
  - 3 Barbarian: Subclass: Giant, Giant’s Rage, Thaumaturgy
  - 4 Barbarian: Feat: Tavern Brawler
  - 5 Barbarian: Boot of the Giants
  - 6 Barbarian: Elemental Cleaver
  - 7 Rogue: Skill Expertise
  - 8 Rogue: Cunning Actions
  - 9 Rogue: Subclass: Thief
  - 10 Rogue: Feat: Alert
  - 11 Fighter: Fighting Style: Defense
  - 12 Fighter: Action Surge

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Introduces the Giant subclass, centered around throwing weapons (and even enemies), adding “range, versatility, and a fresh strategic layer.”
- Adds new spells/cantrips; the guide highlights Booming Blade and notes a High Elf cantrip pick as a workaround for access.
- Notes Half-Orc “remains the go-to race for pure damage,” while highlighting a “High Elf Giant Barbarian” as a fun option.

### Patch 7
- “The Berserker Barbarian combat and gameplay remains unchanged in Patch 7.”
- Patch focus is described as mod manager / in-game modding tool and evil dialogue/cut scenes, with “don’t expect many gameplay differences outside of honor mode difficulty.”
