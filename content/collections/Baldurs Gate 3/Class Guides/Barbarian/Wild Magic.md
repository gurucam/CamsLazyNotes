## Build snapshot
### Fantasy / flavor
- Wild, chaotic Barbarian whose Rage triggers **random magical surges** (sometimes absurdly strong).
- Gets real party utility at Level 6 with **Bolstering Magic** (boon + spell slot restores).
- Plays like a melee burst DPS… with occasional magical “wildcard” turns.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- Rage into a **Wild Magic surge**, smash with **Reckless Attack + GWM**, and pre-buff with **Bolstering Magic** so your burst turns never slow down.

### Party role
- Frontline burst DPS with occasional AoE/control from surges.
- Support-adjacent bruiser that can **feed casters spell slots** and help vs spell-heavy fights.

### Pros
- Explosive damage turns once GWM + Extra Attack + Action Surge are online.
- Bolstering Magic adds real group value (attack boon + spell slot restores).
- Unstable Backlash at 10 can turn incoming damage into extra surge value.

### Cons
- Surges are unpredictable—some are awkward depending on positioning.
- Still lives and dies by melee uptime; you need movement and good target selection.

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Rage: Wild Magic** + Magic Awareness (the subclass “turns on”).
- Level 4: **Great Weapon Master** (bonus action attacks start).
- Level 5: **Extra Attack** (big damage spike).
- Level 6: **Bolstering Magic** (pre-buff boon + slot restores).
- Level 10: **Unstable Backlash** (more surge cycling).
- Level 12: **Action Surge** (double-turn burst).

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Half-Orc
- **Class:** Barbarian
- **Subclass:** Wild Magic
- **Background:** Soldier
- **Skills:** Survival, Perception
- **Abilities (target):** STR 16 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 8 / WIS 10 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Half-Orc)
- **Relentless Endurance** (survivability “fail-safe” when you’d drop)
- **Savage Attacks** (extra damage on crits—perfect for kill/crit snowball turns)
- **Darkvision** (quality-of-life)

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **High Elf** (take **Booming Blade** as your free cantrip if you want to experiment).

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Complete Prologue
- Recruit Companions
- Unlock Withers, respec companions to proper class/ability score

- Progress to level 5
- Reach Underdark and Grymforge
- Check all Permanent Bonuses in Act 1 and the best Gear

## Level-by-level progression (Barbarian 1 → 10, Fighter 1 → 2)
> This build is very “turn-plan” driven. Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop.

### Level 1 — Barbarian 1
**Gain**
- **Unarmoured Defence** (AC = 10 + DEX mod + CON mod while not wearing armour; shields still work)
- **Rage** (bonus damage + physical resistances; keep it active by attacking or taking damage)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Start real fights by using **Rage** as your bonus action, then close distance and attack.
- Keep a ranged weapon equipped so you can always attack once per turn to maintain Rage.
- Plan your gear: **Bracers of Defence** only work with **no armour**, but medium armour can give higher AC—pick one approach and build around it.
- Do **not** wear heavy armour (it breaks Rage mechanics).

### Level 2 — Barbarian 2
**Gain**
- **Reckless Attack** (Advantage on melee attacks; enemies get Advantage to hit you until your next turn)
- **Danger Sense** (Advantage on Dexterity saves vs traps, spells, surfaces)

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Use **Reckless Attack** as your main damage button; it’s worth it when you can end threats quickly.
- Turn 1 Rage → charge; if you can’t reach melee, fire a ranged shot to keep Rage active.

### Level 3 — Barbarian 3
**Gain**
- **Subclass: Wild Magic**
- **Rage: Wild Magic** (your Rage triggers a random magical effect)
- **Magic Awareness** (bonus action: allies in range add proficiency bonus to saves vs spells for 1 turn)
- **Extra Rage charge**

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Open with **Rage: Wild Magic** every fight; lean into whatever surge you roll (some are huge tempo swings).
- Use **Reckless Attack** as your default action; **Magic Awareness** is your early bonus action utility when fighting casters.

### Level 4 — Barbarian 4
**Gain**
- **Feat: Great Weapon Master (GWM)** (crit/kill → bonus action attack; toggleable -5 to hit / +10 damage)

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Spend your **Action** first and save your **bonus action** for the GWM follow-up attack.
- Toggle off the -5/+10 portion if accuracy is too low; toggle it back on when your hit chance improves.
- Focus low-health targets to chain kills and create extra attacks.

### Level 5 — Barbarian 5
**Gain**
- **Extra Attack** (2 attacks with the Attack action)
- **Fast Movement** (+ movement while not wearing heavy armour)

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Core loop: turn 1 Rage → **two attacks** → try to proc **GWM bonus attack** via kill/crit.
- Hard fights: stack **Potion of Speed/Haste** for more actions and a higher chance to proc GWM.
- Use weapon skills (e.g., Lacerate) when they help set up later turns or lock down enemies.

### Level 6 — Barbarian 6
**Gain**
- **Bolstering Magic: Boon** (action: +1d4 to Attack Rolls and Ability Checks for 10 turns)
- **Bolstering Magic: Spell Slot restore** (Level 1/2 slots for an ally)
- **Additional Rage charge**

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Best use: **pre-buff** with Bolstering Magic Boon right before a fight so you don’t spend an action mid-combat.
- Spell slot restores are clutch on longer adventuring days—feed your party casters resources when long rests are tight.

### Level 7 — Barbarian 7
**Gain**
- **Feral Instinct** (+3 Initiative; can’t be Surprised)

**Play style (Level 7)**
- High initiative means you start fights early—delete or disable priority targets before they act.

### Level 8 — Barbarian 8
**Gain**
- **Feat: Ability Improvement** (+2 STR → target 18)

**Play style (Level 8)**
- More STR improves hit chance and damage, which increases your GWM consistency (kill/crit → bonus attack).
- Anything that boosts hit chance (e.g., Bless) or advantage increases your “2 attacks + GWM” loop reliability.

### Level 9 — Barbarian 9
**Gain**
- **Brutal Critical** (extra damage die on critical hits)
- **Bolstering Magic: Level 3 Spell Slot restore** (for an ally)

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Mostly passive power—keep playing aggressive and let crits/kills fuel your GWM turns.
- Use the Level 3 slot restore when your party needs to stretch resources between long rests.

### Level 10 — Barbarian 10
**Gain**
- **Unstable Backlash** (while enraged, taking damage or failing a save triggers a new Wild Magic effect)

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Expect more surge cycling—sometimes it’s chaos, sometimes it’s a huge upgrade. Position so you can capitalize on the better surges.

### Level 11 — Fighter 1
**Gain**
- **Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting** (reroll 1s/2s on damage dice with two-handed weapons)
- **Second Wind** (bonus action self-heal)

**Play style (Level 11)**
- This is the setup turn for Level 12: you’re here for **Action Surge**.
- Second Wind is fine in a pinch, but potions usually heal more—use whichever fits the moment.

### Level 12 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- **Action Surge** (extra action, recharges on short rest)

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Your burst turn math from the guide: **2 attacks** → **Action Surge (2 more)** → **Haste/Potion of Speed (2 more)** → (optional) **GWM bonus attack**.
- If you stay Barbarian 12 instead, take **+2 STR** or **Alert**—but Action Surge is the multiclass payoff.
