## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Ultimate melee warrior relying on raw strength and ferocity to tear through enemies.
- Channels chaotic and unpredictable magical energy into rage, tapping into randomness and wild magic.
- The randomness of encounters is what’s interesting, different, and fun about the build.

### Core Playstyle
- Use a two-handed weapon, stay aggressive in melee, activate your Wild Magic rage for a random extra effect, and lean on durability and simple high single-target damage (avoid heavy armour because it ruins Rage mechanics).

### Party Role
- Front-line melee damage dealer focused on high single-target damage, simplicity, and durability.
- Durable bruiser with Rage-based physical damage resistance and strong Strength checks/saving throws while raging.
- Unpredictable wildcard: rage can add a random magical effect that can help or hinder you.

### Pros
- High single-target damage.
- Durable and hard to bring down while raging (damage resistance).
- Unique and fun due to Wild Magic randomness when you rage.

### Cons
- Rage: Wild Magic can backfire (random effects can help or hinder you).
- You can’t cast or concentrate on spells while raging.
- Using clothing for gear sets can involve risk and reward due to lower AC (more vulnerable to hits).

### Power Spikes
- Level 3: Subclass Wild Magic (Rage: Wild Magic) and Magic Awareness.
- Level 4: Great Weapon Master feat (bonus attack utility).
- Level 5: Extra Attack (plus Fast Movement).
- Level 6: Bolstering Magic (Boon + spell slot recovery options).
- Level 7: Feral Instinct (+3 Initiative; can’t be surprised).
- Level 12: Action Surge (via Fighter multiclass in this setup).

## Character Creation
- Race: Half-Orc
- Class: Barbarian
- Subclass: Wild Magic
- Background: Soldier
- Ability Scores: STR 16, DEX 14, CON 16, INT 8, WIS 10, CHA 10
- Proficiencies: Survival, Perception

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain: Unarmored Defense; Rage
- Play Style: Use your bonus action to activate Rage on the first turn, then attack. Rage ends early if you don’t attack an enemy or take damage each turn; you can’t cast or concentrate on spells while raging. You want to either use medium armor or clothing, and a two-handed weapon preferred a Greatsword.

### Level 2
- Gain: Reckless Attack; Dangerous Sense
- Play Style: Use Rage as your bonus action first turn and charge into battle. If you are in melee range, hit with Reckless Attack as your main damage dealer; keep moving forward and use ranged attacks if necessary to keep Rage active.

### Level 3
- Gain: Subclass: Wild Magic; Extra Rage Charge; Magic Awareness; Rage: Wild Magic
- Play Style: Continue activating Rage: Wild Magic at the start of your turn using a bonus action. Use Reckless Attack as your primary damage source. On your second turn, you now have an optional Magic Awareness to help with defense against spells.

### Level 4
- Gain: Feat: Great Weapon Master
- Play Style: Look to kill lower health targets to take advantage of Great Weapon Master. Combat should be initiated using your action first, saving your bonus action for a Great Weapon Master attack after a critical hit or kill.

### Level 5
- Gain: Extra Attack; Fast Movement
- Play Style: First turn is standard: bonus action to activate Rage and charge in with Reckless Attack. Extra Attack plus Great Weapon Master bonus action attack allows multiple attacks per turn; in hard fights, a Potion of Speed adds even more attacks.

### Level 6
- Gain: Additional Rage Charge; Bolstering Magic: Boon; Bolstering Magic: Level 1 Spell Slot; Bolstering Magic: Level 2 Spell Slot
- Play Style: Bolstering Magic: Boon can be used as a pre-buff outside combat (it lasts 10 turns). Spell slot recovery can be used inside or outside combat; gameplay otherwise remains unchanged.

### Level 7
- Gain: Feral Instinct
- Play Style: You gain a +3 bonus to Initiative and can’t be surprised, helping you act early in the first round to eliminate the highest priority target and reduce damage for you and your team.

### Level 8
- Gain: Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Strength to reach 18)
- Play Style: The premise is to constantly critical strike or land killing blows to proc Great Weapon Master’s bonus action attack. Keep it simple and aggressive.

### Level 9
- Gain: Brutal Critical; Bolstering Magic: Level 3 Spell Slot
- Play Style: Not much changes besides passive benefits like Brutal Critical. Level 3 Spell Slot recovery is a tool that can be helpful when every long rest is painful on resources.

### Level 10
- Gain: Unstable Backlash
- Play Style: While enraged, when you take damage or fail a saving throw, you trigger another Wild Magic effect that replaces the current one—adding more chaos and uncertainty.

### Level 11
- Gain: Fighter (Great Weapon Fighting Style; Second Wind)
- Play Style: The reason given for multiclassing is Action Surge later (a once-per-short-rest extra action in combat). If you do not wish to multiclass, the guide notes you can continue Barbarian and take Ability Improvement +2 Strength at level 12 instead.

### Level 12
- Gain: Fighter (Action Surge)
- Play Style: Action Surge gives an extra action in combat (recharges on short rest). With Great Weapon Master and Extra Attack, this adds significantly more attacks; the guide notes you can take this further with Haste effects. If you wanted a traditional Barbarian for all 12 levels, the guide suggests Ability Improvement +2 Strength or the Alert feat.
