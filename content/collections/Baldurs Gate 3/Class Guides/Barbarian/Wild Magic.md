## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Barbarians are the ultimate melee warriors, relying on their raw strength and ferocity to tear through their enemies.
- Wild Magic Barbarians focuses on channeling chaotic and unpredictable magical energy into their rage, allowing them to tap into the forces of randomness and wild magic.
- What’s interesting, different, and fun about this build is the randomness of the encounters.

### Core Playstyle
- Use medium armor, a Two-Handed weapon, maintain the identity of the Barbarian, and stay aggressive; when you activate Rage (Rage: Wild Magic with this subclass), you gain an extra effect; this build is still focused on high single-target damage, simplicity, and durability.

### Party Role
- High single-target damage, simplicity, and durability.
- Resistance to physical damage and Advantage on Strength checks and Saving Throws while raging.
- Unpredictable Rage that gives random effects (can help or hinder you).

### Pros
- Can deal a lot of damage in a short amount of time.
- Takes a lot of hits (durability / damage resistance).
- Randomness that makes it a unique subclass in Baldur’s Gate 3.

### Cons
- Important to be aware of the risks of Rage Wild Magic, as it can easily backfire.
- You can’t cast or concentrate on spells while raging.
- Do not use any heavy armour (it will ruin the build and specifically Rage mechanics).

### Power Spikes
- Level 3: Wild Magic subclass (Rage: Wild Magic, Magic Awareness, Extra Rage Charge).
- Level 4: Great Weapon Master feat (bonus attack utility).
- Level 5: Extra Attack (plus Fast Movement).
- Level 6: Bolstering Magic (Boon and spell slot recovery).
- Level 7: Feral Instinct (+3 Initiative; can’t be surprised).
- Level 12: Fighter Action Surge (via multiclass in this setup).

  - Notes:
    - Rage ends early if you don’t attack an enemy or take damage each turn.

### Level 2

  - Dangerous Sense
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Rage as your bonus action first turn and charge into battle; if you are in melee range, hit with Reckless Attack; make sure to equip a bow in case you cannot reach a target on your first turn.
    - Turn 2+: Keep moving forward and use ranged attacks if necessary to keep rage active.

    - Great Weapon Master: critical hit or kill lets you make another melee attack as a bonus action.
    - Great Weapon Master toggle: you can turn this off in the Passive section on your toolbar (turn off if the percentage is too low; turn back on when enemies are around 50% or higher to hit).
    - Look for support classes that have Bless (increases your chance of landing).

### Level 5

  - Notes:
    - Bolstering Magic: Boon lasts 10 turns and can be pre-cast / pre-buff before combat so you don’t use this during combat and consume an action.

    - Ending Act 1: visit traders and stock up on camp and alchemy supplies; find the best Act 1 items; permanent bonuses in Act 1; Grymforge has powerful armor and weapons (Adamantine) that can be used well into Act 3; in Act 2, you won’t be able to return.

- Here are 10 gameplay tips specifically for playing a Barbarian in Baldur’s Gate 3:
  1. Use Rage Wisely: Activate this and stay aggressive. You need to either do damage or be damaged so play up close.
  2. Initial Turn: Make sure your initial move either puts you in melee range so you can strike or attack with range to keep Rage active.
  3. Bonus Action: Use your bonus action as an attack after you critical strike or kill someone with Great Weapon Master.
  4. Prioritize melee combat: Use different weapons based on their strength and unique skills, like Cleave for Area damage.
  5. Wild Magic: Expect some randomness every time you enter Rage Wild Magic, which can be helpful with more damage.
  6. Reckless Attack: Use this attack when it’s likely you will not receive a return blow.
  7. Potion of Speed: Use these potions to gain bigger movement and more actions in challenging fights.
  8. Boon: Use the Magic Boon skills outside of combat when you expect a fight because it last 10 turns.
  9. Long Rest: Make sure to rest when your Rage and Frenzy counters are low so you start with many available.
  10. Great Weapon Master: Try to target low-health enemies with a high chance to hit so you can proc a free extra attack if you kill them.

## Alternative Build Route
- If you do not wish to multi-class to Fighter for Action Surge, continue and take the Ability Improvement +2 Strength at level 12 with the Barbarian.
- If you wanted a traditional Barbarian for all 12 levels, take Ability Improvement +2 Strength or the Alert feat which helps with going early.
- Patch 8 note: you can pick up Booming Blade by choosing the High Elf race, which allows you to select one cantrip during character creation (Half-Orc remains the stronger choice for raw burst damage, but High Elf can be a fun alternative if you’re looking to experiment with new mechanics).

## Patch Changes
### Patch 7
- This build page has been updated for the Patch 8 version of Baldur’s Gate 3.

### Patch 8
- The biggest change to the Barbarian in Patch 8 is the introduction of the Giant subclass, which focuses entirely on throwing weapons and maximizing throw-based damage.
- Patch 8 also includes updates to spells and cantrips, with Booming Blade standing out as a particularly useful addition.
- While Barbarians don’t typically gain access to cantrips, you can pick up Booming Blade by choosing the High Elf race, which allows you to select one cantrip during character creation.
