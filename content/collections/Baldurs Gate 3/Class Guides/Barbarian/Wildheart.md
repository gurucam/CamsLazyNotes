## Build snapshot
### Fantasy / flavor
- Animal-spirit Barbarian that trades Berserker’s extra bonus-action attacks for **mobility + control**.
- Elk Heart gives you a “stampede engage” that can knock multiple enemies **Prone** while you stay durable.
- Still plays like a classic greatsword Barbarian—just with a more tactical opener and passive boosts.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- Rage early, use **Primal Stampede** to engage/Prone when needed, then snowball turns with **Reckless Attack + Great Weapon Master**.

### Party role
- Frontline bruiser that **starts fights fast** (movement + initiative) and controls space with Prone.
- Reliable “first in, first out” melee threat that sets up advantage for teammates.

### Pros
- Excellent engage tools (Elk Heart) and strong mobility scaling.
- Very simple damage loop once GWM + Extra Attack are online.
- Strong Honour Mode tempo: act early, reach targets, and reduce enemy actions with Prone.

### Cons
- Less bonus-action “built-in” damage than Berserker (you rely on GWM procs).
- Your heart/aspect choices matter—pick intentionally and build around them.

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Wildheart + Elk Heart** (Primal Stampede unlocks).
- Level 4: **Great Weapon Master** (bonus action attacks start).
- Level 5: **Extra Attack** (huge damage jump).
- Level 6: **Elk Aspect** (party movement aura).
- Level 10: **Tiger Aspect** (Bleed/Poison synergy).
- Level 12: **Action Surge** (double-turn burst).

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Half-Orc
- **Class:** Barbarian
- **Subclass:** Wildheart
- **Background:** Soldier
- **Skills:** Survival, Perception
- **Abilities (target):** STR 16 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 8 / WIS 10 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Half-Orc)
- **Relentless Endurance** (survivability “fail-safe” when you’d drop)
- **Savage Attacks** (extra damage on crits—perfect for kill/crit snowball turns)
- **Darkvision** (quality-of-life)

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **High Elf** (take **Booming Blade** as your free cantrip if you want to experiment).

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Complete Prologue
- Recruit Companions
- Unlock Withers, respec companions to proper class/ability score
- Collect the Necromancy of Thay (important in Act 3)
- Reach Druid Grove
- Sell, stock up, complete quests
- Unlock summons (Scratch, Shovel)
- Progress to level 5
- Reach Underdark and Grymforge
- Check all Permanent Bonuses in Act 1 and the best Gear

## Level-by-level progression (Barbarian 1 → 10, Fighter 1 → 2)
> This build is very “turn-plan” driven. Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop.

### Level 1 — Barbarian 1
**Gain**
- **Unarmoured Defence** (AC = 10 + DEX mod + CON mod while not wearing armour; shields still work)
- **Rage** (bonus damage + physical resistances; keep it active by attacking or taking damage)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Use **Rage** as your bonus action on your first real turn, then close distance and attack.
- Keep a ranged weapon equipped so you can always attack once per turn to maintain Rage.
- Use **medium armour or clothing** based on your gear plan—don’t mix in ways that disable key bonuses (e.g., Bracers of Defence only work without armour).
- Do **not** wear heavy armour (it breaks Rage mechanics).

### Level 2 — Barbarian 2
**Gain**
- **Reckless Attack** (Advantage on melee attacks; enemies get Advantage to hit you until your next turn)
- **Danger Sense** (Advantage on Dexterity saves vs traps, spells, surfaces)

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Default to **Reckless Attack** when you can likely secure a kill or won’t be focused next turn.
- Rage turn 1 → charge in; if you can’t reach melee, use a ranged attack to keep Rage active.

### Level 3 — Barbarian 3
**Gain**
- **Subclass: Wildheart**
- **Speak with Animals** (free utility spell)
- **Bestial Heart: Elk (recommended)**
- **Primal Stampede** (Elk Heart action: charge up to 9m; hits enemies in a line, deals bludgeoning damage, and knocks **Prone**)

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Turn 1: **Rage** (bonus action) → decide between **Reckless Attack** (damage) or **Primal Stampede** (engage + Prone CC).
- Use Stampede when you need to **close distance**, hit multiple targets, or knock priority enemies **Prone** for your team.
- Your bonus action is still mostly for Rage/potions at this stage—your “extra attack” engine starts at Level 4 with GWM.

### Level 4 — Barbarian 4
**Gain**
- **Feat: Great Weapon Master (GWM)** (crit/kill → bonus action attack; toggleable -5 to hit / +10 damage)

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Start fights by spending your **Action** first and **save your bonus action** for a GWM follow-up (after a kill or crit).
- If your hit chance is low, **toggle off** the -5/+10 part; toggle it back on when accuracy improves.
- Prioritize **low-HP targets** to trigger the bonus action attack and snowball your turn.

### Level 5 — Barbarian 5
**Gain**
- **Extra Attack** (2 attacks with the Attack action)
- **Fast Movement** (+ movement while not wearing heavy armour)

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Your core loop becomes: turn 1 Rage → **Attack twice** → fish for a kill/crit → **GWM bonus attack**.
- Use weapon skills like **Lacerate** (Bleeding) when it helps set up your Level 10 Tiger Aspect later.
- In hard fights, stack **Potion of Speed/Haste** for even more actions (and more chances to proc GWM).

### Level 6 — Barbarian 6
**Gain**
- **Animal Aspect: Elk (recommended)** (+1.5m movement speed for you and nearby allies)
- **Additional Rage charge**

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Pre-buff with movement: Elk Aspect + Haste Helm makes it much easier to reach melee on turn 1.
- Around Level 6 you’re often wrapping Act 1—stock camp/alchemy supplies and consider crafting **Adamantine** gear in Grymforge.

### Level 7 — Barbarian 7
**Gain**
- **Feral Instinct** (+3 Initiative; can’t be Surprised)
- Optional: **swap Bestial Heart** if you want (Elk is still a great default).

**Play style (Level 7)**
- High initiative means you reliably act early—use that to **stun/Prone** or delete a priority target before it moves.
- If your party can apply **Surprised** (e.g., Gloom Stalker / Assassin openers), let them start the fight for even stronger first-round tempo.

### Level 8 — Barbarian 8
**Gain**
- **Feat: Ability Improvement** (+2 STR → target 18)
- **Land’s Stride: Difficult Terrain** (difficult terrain no longer slows you)
- Optional: **swap Bestial Heart**

**Play style (Level 8)**
- More STR = better accuracy = more reliable GWM procs (kill/crit → bonus action attack).
- Anything that boosts hit chance (e.g., **Bless**) or advantage increases your “2 attacks + GWM” consistency.

### Level 9 — Barbarian 9
**Gain**
- **Brutal Critical** (extra damage die on critical hits)
- Optional: **swap Bestial Heart** (Elk still recommended).

**Play style (Level 9)**
- This is mostly a passive power bump—keep playing aggressive and let your crit/kill turns snowball.

### Level 10 — Barbarian 10
**Gain**
- **Animal Aspect: Tiger (recommended)** (adds STR modifier vs Bleeding/Poisoned targets; synergizes with Lacerate + poisons)

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Use **Lacerate** (Bleeding) on your greatsword to enable Tiger’s bonus more often.
- Coat weapons with poison (e.g., **Drow Poison**) when you want to force Poisoned/Asleep rolls and feed Tiger’s passive.

### Level 11 — Fighter 1
**Gain**
- **Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting** (reroll 1s/2s on damage dice with two-handed weapons)
- **Second Wind** (bonus action self-heal)

**Play style (Level 11)**
- This level is about setting up Level 12: you’re taking Fighter primarily for **Action Surge**.
- Second Wind is “fine,” but potions often outperform it—use it when you need a bonus action heal without spending an item.

### Level 12 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- **Action Surge** (extra action, recharges on short rest)

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Your burst turn becomes: **Attack (2)** → **Action Surge Attack (2 more)** → (optional) **Haste/Potion of Speed Attack (2 more)** → (optional) **GWM bonus attack**.
- If you prefer pure Barbarian 12, the guide calls out **+2 STR** or **Alert** as alternatives—but Action Surge is the reason to multiclass here.
