## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Focuses on the Wildheart subclass for the Barbarian class, which provides an additional animal spirit for extra abilities and passive effects.
- This subclass is straightforward with both passive and active benefits, meant for those who want a simple Barbarian that can be customized with an animal spirit.
- Barbarians are ultimate melee warriors who enter a state of rage to increase damage output and durability.

### Core Playstyle
- Activate Rage on turn one, and stay aggressive, making sure to attack or be hit each turn.

### Party Role
- Charges in melee range while allies provide support, ranged damage, or stealth attacks.
- Fits the traditional RPG “holy trinity” party planning (Tank, Healer, and DPS) as the melee damage presence while the party rounds out healer and ranged damage.
- Uses aggression, damage, and movement speed to survive and fight.

### Pros
- Additional animal spirit for extra abilities and passive effects.
- Proficient with all weapons and armor, making them versatile combatants.
- Extra Attack allows two attacks with one action.

### Cons
- Unlike the Berserker, the Wildheart won’t have two additional abilities for bonus actions.
- Rage ends early if you don’t attack an enemy or take damage each turn, and you can’t cast or concentrate on spells while raging.
- Do not use any heavy armour: “It will ruin the build and specifically the Rage mechanics.”

### Power Spikes
- Level 3: Wildheart Subclass, Bestial Heart choice, and Primal Stampede (Elk Heart).
- Level 4: Great Weapon Master feat.
- Level 5: Extra Attack.
- Level 7: Feral Instinct (+3 bonus to Initiative and can’t be surprised).
- Level 12: Fighter Action Surge (via multiclass).

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Use Rage Wisely: Activate this and stay aggressive. You need to either do damage or be damaged so play up close.
- Initial Turn: Make sure your initial move either puts you in melee range so you can strike or attack with range to keep Rage active.
- Bonus Action: use your bonus action as an attack after you critical strike or kill someone with Great Weapon Master.
- Prioritize melee combat: build for higher movement to take advantage of strength-based melee weapons
- Crowd Control: use your Primal Stampede to close the distance and stun one or more targets.
- Reckless Attack: Use this attack when it’s likely you will not receive a return blow.
- Potion of Speed: Use these potions to gain bigger movement and more action in challenging fights.
- Bestial Heart: pick bonuses that help with your group, and swap these out if you don’t feel one is useful.
- Long Rest: Make sure to rest when your Rage and Frenzy counters are low so you start with many available.
- Great Weapon Master: Try to target low-health enemies with a high chance of hit so you can proc a free extra attack if you kill them.

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- Patch 8 introduces the Giant subclass, specializing in throwing weapons and enemies, opening a ranged playstyle.
- Patch 8 expands spells and cantrips; Booming Blade is highlighted as a standout.
- A workaround mentioned: selecting the High Elf race grants a free cantrip at character creation to pick up Booming Blade early on.
- “It won’t be the optimal path for raw damage output because Half-Orc still dominates in terms of pure burst potential.”

### Patch 7
- “The release of Patch 7 for BG3 brought with it no significant combat, gameplay, or build-related change for the Wildheart Barbarian.”
- Patch 7 focus: “final narrative additions mostly centered around evil endings,” plus “official modding tools and adjustments to honour mode.”
- “The game now features a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager…”
