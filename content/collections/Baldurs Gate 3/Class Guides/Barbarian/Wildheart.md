## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- A Barbarian customized with an animal spirit, gaining additional animal abilities and passive effects.
- A straightforward subclass with both passive and active benefits that revolves around Rage.
- A raw, ferocious melee warrior that relies on strength, durability, and aggression to tear through enemies.

### Core Playstyle
- Activate Rage on turn one, stay aggressive, and make sure to attack or be hit each turn to keep Rage active while closing distance and pressuring targets.

### Party Role
- Front-line melee damage dealer built around Rage, Extra Attack, and a two-handed weapon.
- Durable brawler that leans on damage resistance while raging and high Constitution for staying power.
- Crowd control and engagement toolset to close distance and knock targets Prone via your Wildheart rage option.

### Pros
- Simple, straightforward gameplay with passive and active benefits.
- Strong mobility and initiative tools later (movement bonuses and +3 Initiative, can’t be surprised).
- High multi-attack potential with Extra Attack and bonus action follow-ups tied to your feat choice.

### Cons
- Compared to Berserker, the Wildheart “won’t have two additional abilities for bonus actions.”
- Rage ends early if you don’t attack an enemy or take damage each turn.
- You can’t cast or concentrate on spells while raging.

### Power Spikes
- Level 3: Wildheart subclass unlock plus a Bestial Heart option that changes what Rage grants you.
- Level 4: Great Weapon Master feat for bonus action attacks on kills/critical hits.
- Level 5: Extra Attack (paired with your feat) for a major jump in turn-to-turn damage.
- Level 7: Feral Instinct (+3 Initiative and can’t be surprised).
- Level 11–12: Fighter multiclass for Great Weapon Fighting Style, then Action Surge.

## Character Creation
- Race: Half-Orc
- Class: Barbarian
- Subclass: Wildheart
- Background: Soldier
- Ability Scores: STR 16, DEX 14, CON 16, INT 8, WIS 10, CHA 10
- Proficiencies: Survival, Perception

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain: Unarmored Defense; Rage
- Play Style: Use Rage as a bonus action on your first turn and charge in. Stay aggressive—make sure you attack or take damage each turn so Rage doesn’t end early. Use a two-handed weapon (preferred Greatsword), and keep a ranged weapon available so you can always attack once per turn to keep Rage active.

### Level 2
- Gain: Reckless Attack; Danger Sense
- Play Style: Use Rage on turn one and charge into combat. If in melee range, use Reckless Attack as your main damage dealer (Advantage on melee attacks, but enemies have Advantage against you until your next turn). Keep moving forward and use ranged attacks if necessary to keep Rage active.

### Level 3
- Gain: Subclass: Wildheart; Extra Rage Charge; Speak with Animals; Pick 1 Bestial Heart (recommended Elk Heart); Elk Heart unlocks Primal Stampede (Action)
- Play Style: Rage on the first turn (bonus action) and you’ll unlock your Wildheart rage action from the chosen heart. Use your main attacks as usual, and use your heart’s rage action when you need mobility/crowd control or can’t get in range.

### Level 4
- Gain: Feat: Great Weapon Master
- Play Style: Great Weapon Master gives (1) a high risk/high reward toggle (-5 attack roll, +10 damage) and (2) a bonus action melee attack after a critical hit or killing a creature. Start combat using your action first and save your bonus action for the bonus attack when it triggers; look to kill lower health targets to take advantage of the bonus action follow-up.

### Level 5
- Gain: Extra Attack; Fast Movement (+5 movement speed while not wearing heavy armor); (Optional) you can change your bestial heart selection
- Play Style: This is a major jump in output: Rage on turn one, then pressure targets with multiple attacks from Extra Attack and potential bonus action attacks from your feat. In harder fights, the guide notes you can use a Potion of Speed to add more action economy.

### Level 6
- Gain: Aspect of the Beast (recommended Elk); Additional Rage Charge
- Play Style: Keep the same aggressive loop, now supported by a movement-focused passive option for you and nearby allies (+1.5m movement speed). This supports reaching melee range quickly and staying on targets.

### Level 7
- Gain: Feral Instinct; (Optional) you can change your bestial heart selection
- Play Style: Your gameplay remains the same, but the build becomes more reliable at starting fights: +3 Initiative and you can’t be surprised, helping ensure you act early in round one.

### Level 8
- Gain: Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Strength, to 18); Land’s Stride: Difficult Terrain; (Optional) you can change your bestial heart selection
- Play Style: Continue the same premise: two attacks, aiming for kills/critical hits to trigger Great Weapon Master’s bonus action attack. Land’s Stride prevents Difficult Terrain from slowing you down.

### Level 9
- Gain: Brutal Critical; (Optional) you can change your bestial heart selection
- Play Style: The guide describes gameplay as very simple at this stage—most of what changes is passive power (more damage on critical hits).

### Level 10
- Gain: Aspect of the Beast (recommended Tiger)
- Play Style: Continue using a two-handed Greatsword play pattern. The Tiger aspect adds your Strength modifier to attack rolls against Bleeding or Poisoned targets and grants proficiency in Survival; the guide calls out that Greatswords can apply Bleeding via their weapon skill and you can apply poison consumables to your weapon.

### Level 11
- Gain: Multi-class Fighter (recommended): Great Weapon Fighting Style; Second Wind
- Play Style: The guide recommends taking Fighter levels for Action Surge later. This level can feel uneventful, but it sets up the next level’s payoff; Second Wind is a bonus action heal.

### Level 12
- Gain: Fighter: Action Surge
- Play Style: Action Surge adds an extra action (recharging on short rest), multiplying your attack count when combined with Extra Attack and Great Weapon Master’s bonus action follow-ups.
