## Character Creation
- Race: Dwarf
- Subrace: Duergar
- Class: 6 Barbarian, 4 Rogue, 2 Fighter
- Subclass: Giant, Thief
- Background: Soldier
- Ability Scores: Strength 17, Dexterity 16, Constitution 15, Intelligence 8, Wisdom 8, Charisma 8
- Proficiencies: Skills (Perception, Survival); Saving Throws (Strength, Dexterity); Armour (Light Armour, Medium Armour, Shield); Weapons (Martial, Simple)

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain: Unarmored Defense; Rage
- Play Style: Use melee and ranged weapons early; Rage adds extra damage and Resistance to physical damage, but you can’t cast or concentrate on spells while raging.

### Level 2
- Gain: Reckless Attack; Danger Sense
- Play Style: Use Rage as your bonus action on turn one and charge into combat; Reckless Attack is your main damage skill until Level 4, but enemies gain advantage against you until your next turn.

### Level 3
- Gain: Subclass: Giant; Giant’s Rage; Vaprak’s Greed; Thaumaturgy
- Play Style: Start throwing heavy items (extra weapons and spears); items won’t return until you get a specific Act 1 weapon or reach level 6 as a Barbarian, so save random spears and junk for ranged damage.

### Level 4
- Gain: Feat: Tavern Brawler
- Play Style: Activate Giant’s Rage on turn one, then throw weapons/objects; Tavern Brawler adds your Strength modifier twice to damage and attack rolls whenever you throw a weapon.

### Level 5
- Gain: Extra Attack; Fast Movement; Boot of the Giants
- Play Style: Extra Attack lets you make two attacks per Attack action; use Boot of the Giants as a bonus action on turn two or beyond to kick targets away (higher chance if hidden or invisible) and knock enemies off ledges/cliffs.

### Level 6
- Gain: Elemental Cleaver
- Play Style: Channel primordial might into your weapon during Rage to add Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage; your weapon gains the Thrown property and immediately reappears in your hand if thrown, enabling melee or ranged play and damage-type flexibility.

### Level 7
- Gain: Multiclass to Rogue (Level 1 Rogue); Skill (Athletics and Acrobatics); Sneak Attack (Ranged & Melee)
- Play Style: Set Sneak Attack reactions to “Ask” so it triggers when applicable; watch for Advantage to maximize Sneak Attack damage.

### Level 8
- Gain: Rogue Level 2; Cunning Action: Hide; Cunning Action: Dash; Cunning Action: Disengage
- Play Style: Use bonus-action mobility and hiding for positioning; attacking or casting a spell will reveal your location after hiding.

### Level 9
- Gain: Rogue Subclass: Thief; Fast Hands; Second-Story Work
- Play Style: Fast Hands grants an additional bonus action; use bonus actions each turn for damage potential and utility.

### Level 10
- Gain: Feat: Alert
- Play Style: Alert grants +5 Initiative and prevents being Surprised, helping you take the first turn and do multiple throws in the opening turn.

### Level 11
- Gain: Multiclass to Fighter (Level 1 Fighter); Fighting Style selection
- Play Style: Great Weapon Fighting is best if you use melee attacks vs. throws, or Defence Style to gain a +1 bonus to Armour Class (AC) only if using armour.

### Level 12
- Gain: Fighter Level 2; Action Surge
- Play Style: Action Surge grants one additional action and is replenished with a Short Rest; this increases attacks in a single turn, but requires short resting to reach full potential.
