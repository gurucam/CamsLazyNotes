## Features and Mechanics
- Giant’s Rage: When in Rage, you double your throw damage; use your Bonus Action to trigger Giant’s Rage on turn one, then throw a weapon or item for massive damage.
- Tavern Brawler: Doubles your thrown weapon Strength modifier for attack rolls and damage.
- Elemental Cleaver: Until the end of your Rage, your weapon deals additional Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage, gains the Thrown property, and immediately reappears in your hand if thrown.
- Boot of the Giants: Try to kick a target away; chances depend on Athletics and are higher if you’re hidden or invisible.
- Athletics is the most critical skill for this build because the effectiveness of Boot of the Giants depends on Athletics.
- Unarmored Defense: While not wearing any armor, Armor Class equals 10 + Dexterity modifier + Constitution modifier; you can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
- Build Summary notes: Armor is Unarmoured (Act 1 and 2) and Light Armour (Act 3).
- Ability score note: Strength is the most important ability score (increases thrown damage); thrown damage comes from Strength, and you can increase this to 22 by getting Auntie Ethel’s Hair in Act 1 (18), a Drink in Act 2 (+2 need Astarion), and Mirror of the Loss in Act 3 (need Shadowheart).

- Sell Frequently: With limited carrying capacity, sell items often and store extras in your traveler’s chest.
- Stealth: Whenever possible, start combat in stealth to trigger the Surprised status effect.
- Consider Illithid Powers: These abilities are strong, though they may alter your appearance—decide if the trade-off is worth it.
- Oils & Elixirs: Use both coatings and elixirs in combat to maximize their combined benefits.
- Persuasion: Whenever you can, resolve conflicts through dialogue to avoid unnecessary fights.
- Priority list (Giant Barbarian build):
  - Complete Prologue

  - Unlock Withers, respec companions to proper ability score or classes

## Alternative Build Route
- You can use any thrown weapon after level 6; you can go with Balduran’s Giant Slayer instead of Nyrulna. However, the combo with Bhaalist Armour is still one of the best.

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- The biggest change to the Barbarian in Patch 8 is the addition of the Giant subclass (throw damage; dedicated to throwing weapons).
- Other changes are related to new spells and cantrips; one that’s useful is Booming Blade (extra thunder damage each action); one way to obtain this cantrip as a Barbarian is using the High Elf race where you select one cantrip at character creation.
- Patch 8 marks the final major content update for Baldur’s Gate 3 and introduces 12 new subclasses (one for each core class).
- Patch 8 includes crossplay support and a new Photo Mode feature.
- No significant rebalancing or gameplay adjustments exist for existing classes or subclasses.
