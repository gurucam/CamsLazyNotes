## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A Barbarian who fights like a **giant**: you Rage, **grow larger**, and turn the battlefield into a throwing range.
- Feels like “**pick something up, hurl it, and keep moving**”—you can play melee when needed, but this build shines at **ranged throw damage**.
- Very “physical” gameplay: positioning, line-of-sight, and target priority matter more than spell rotations.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Giant’s Rage → throw weapons/objects for huge damage**, then stack more actions (Extra Attack, Speed/Bloodlust, Action Surge) to keep deleting targets.

### Party role
- **Ranged bruiser:** deals frontline-tier damage from a safer distance via throws.
- **Priority target remover:** deletes casters/archers early, especially when you win initiative.
- **Battlefield bully:** uses kicks/throws to knock enemies prone or off ledges when the map allows it.

### Pros
- **Range:** you don’t have to spend every turn sprinting to be useful.
- **Solo Honour Mode potential** thanks to damage + survivability.
- **Bonus-action utility** (especially once Rogue/Thief is online).

### Cons
- **Vulnerable to magic** compared to some other frontliners.
- **No spellcasting** (you rely on gear/consumables and teammates for utility).
- **Low movement** early (your range helps, but mobility tools still matter).

### Power spikes to look forward to
- **Level 3:** Giant’s Rage (throw damage plan starts)
- **Level 4:** Tavern Brawler (throw accuracy/damage spikes)
- **Level 5:** Extra Attack + Boot of the Giants (tempo + utility)
- **Level 6:** Elemental Cleaver (any weapon can be thrown + returns)
- **Level 9:** Thief (extra bonus action)
- **Level 12:** Action Surge (big burst turn)

---

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character  
- **Race:** Duergar Dwarf  
- **Class:** Barbarian  
- **Background:** Soldier  
- **Skills:** Perception, Survival  
- **Abilities (point buy target):** STR 17 / DEX 16 / CON 15 / INT 8 / WIS 8 / CHA 8  

### Racial notes (why Duergar)
- **Superior Darkvision**
- **Duergar Resilience**
- **Invisibility spell**
- **Enlarge** (extra damage on weapon attacks)

### Starting setup
- **Weapons:** start with a strong melee weapon (greatsword) *and* keep throwables (spears/junk) for early Giant’s Rage.
- **Armor:** the guide plays **unarmoured** early (Act 1–2), then **light armour** later (Act 3).

### Always-on Honor Mode habits (from the guide)
- **Loot and sell often** (you’ll want gold for consumables and materials).
- Buy crafting mats; **elixirs/potions are huge** for this build.
- **Reach level 6** as soon as you can (major power spike).
- Start fights from **stealth** when possible to trigger **Surprised**.
- Use **oils + elixirs** together (they stack).
- Consider **Illithid powers** if you’re okay with the trade-off.

## Level-by-level progression (Barbarian 1 → 6, Rogue 1 → 4, Fighter 1 → 2)
> This build is very “turn-plan” driven. Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop.

---

### Level 1 — Barbarian 1
**Gain**
- **Unarmoured Defence**
- **Rage**

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Rage when the fight is real: it’s **damage + resistance** and your main survival button.
- Use melee and ranged weapons early; don’t waste turns dashing if you can still attack.
- Keep Rage going: you need to **hit or get hit** each turn or it ends.

---

### Level 2 — Barbarian 2
**Gain**
- **Reckless Attack**
- **Danger Sense**

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Use **Reckless Attack** as your main damage tool (advantage = much more reliable hits).
- Don’t Reckless into obvious danger if you’ll get focused next turn—pick targets you can kill or that won’t clap back.

---

### Level 3 — Barbarian 3
**Subclass**
- **Giant** (Path of Giants)

**Gain**
- **Giant’s Rage** (Rage + grow in size; throw bonus doubled on throws)
- **Vaprak’s Greed** (carry capacity +25%)
- **Thaumaturgy** (cantrip)

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Turn 1 plan: **Bonus Action Giant’s Rage → throw something heavy** for big ranged damage.
- Until your throws return reliably, **stockpile spears/junk/extra weapons** and throw those.
- Look for ledges: throws and knockbacks can turn into “free” kills.

---

### Level 4 — Barbarian 4
**Feat**
- **Tavern Brawler**

**Play style (Level 4)**
- This is your throw build “click”: Tavern Brawler adds your STR modifier **twice** to throw attack rolls and damage.
- Keep STR even (the guide expects STR to land at **18** after this setup).
- Default turn stays the same: **Giant’s Rage → throw → throw again** when you can.

---

### Level 5 — Barbarian 5
**Gain**
- **Extra Attack**
- **Fast Movement**
- **Boot of the Giants** (bonus-action kick; Athletics-based; better if hidden/invisible)

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Extra Attack means you can throw/attack **twice per action**—your damage jumps hard.
- Use **Boot of the Giants** on turn 2+ when you can line up a ledge knock or disrupt a dangerous enemy.
- Start thinking in “action stacking”: Haste/Speed and Bloodlust turns get silly fast.

---

### Level 6 — Barbarian 6
**Subclass feature**
- **Elemental Cleaver** (add elemental damage; weapon gains Thrown; thrown weapon returns to hand during Rage)

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Now you can throw **almost any weapon** and it returns—no more carrying 100 spears.
- Bring multiple damage types (piercing/bludgeoning/etc.) and swap based on resistances/vulnerabilities.
- The guide recommends multiclassing after this point for more bonus-action utility.

---

### Level 7 — Rogue 1
**Multiclass**
- **Rogue 1**

**Pick**
- Skills noted by the guide: **Athletics and Acrobatics** (plus expertise/proficiency if you didn’t already have them)
- **Sneak Attack** (set Reaction to “Ask”)

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Use Rogue mainly for the path to **Thief** (extra bonus action).
- Pay attention to **Advantage** prompts—Sneak Attack adds free damage when it applies.

---

### Level 8 — Rogue 2
**Gain**
- **Cunning Action: Hide**
- **Cunning Action: Dash**
- **Cunning Action: Disengage**

**Play style (Level 8)**
- These bonus actions fix a lot of “wasted turns”: Dash/Disengage keeps you safe and in range.
- Hide can help start fights stronger and keep you from getting focused.

---

### Level 9 — Rogue 3
**Subclass**
- **Thief**

**Gain**
- **Fast Hands** (extra bonus action)
- **Second-Story Work** (fall damage resistance)

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Extra bonus action = more utility and more “doing things” every turn.
- The guide calls out that this can mean **more kicks** and more bonus-action flexibility in your opener.

---

### Level 10 — Rogue 4
**Feat**
- **Alert** *(recommended)*

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Alert gives **+5 initiative** and prevents **Surprised**—great for a build that wants big opening turns.
- If you’re missing permanent stat bonuses, the guide notes you can take an Ability Improvement instead.

---

### Level 11 — Fighter 1
**Multiclass**
- **Fighter 1**

**Gain**
- Fighting Style: **Defence** *(+1 AC if using armour)*  
  - Alternative in the guide: **Great Weapon Fighting** *(if doing more melee than throwing)*

**Play style (Level 11)**
- You’re here to set up **Action Surge** next level—your turn plan stays the same.
- Choose your fighting style based on how often you’re actually swinging in melee.

---

### Level 12 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- **Action Surge**

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Action Surge gives you **one extra action** (recharges on **Short Rest**).
- Burst turn goal: delete the most dangerous enemy before they get a real turn.
