## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
Control the weather, create powerful storms, fly, and deal lightning damage with spells.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- A fragile ranged nuker that Wets enemies to amplify lightning bursts and deletes grouped targets with AoE.

### Party role
Primary ranged damage dealer with burst AoE and some crowd control.

### Pros
- Metamagic spell manipulation
- Massive area damage

### Cons
- Limited spell selection
- Fragile
- Lightning element focused

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: Sorcery Points + Metamagic (Twinned + Distant).
- Level 5: Lightning Bolt.
- Level 6: Heart of the Storm + Storm Spells + Lightning/Thunder resistance
- Level 11: Disintegrate + Storm’s Fury.
- Level 12: Chain Lightning + Charisma 20 (with ASI).

## Character creation

### Racial notes (why High Half-Elf)
High Half-Elf is the best race choice because you gain an extra Cantrip, Fey Ancestry, Darkvision, and Shield Proficiency. Secondary choice: Human (increased carrying capacity, skill proficiency, shield proficiency). Third choice: Dragonborn (Dragon Ancestry, extra spell, resistance).

### Starting setup
- **Class**: Sorcerer
- **Subclass**: Storm Sorcery
- **Background**: Charlatan
- **Skills**: Intimidation, Persuasion
- **Ability scores**: STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 14 / INT 10 / WIS 10 / CHA 16
- **Weapon**: Quarterstaff
- **Armor**: Clothing (do not use armor; Dexterity contributes to AC while wearing clothing)

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Prologue → Withers/respec → reach level 5 → Underdark/Grymforge → best gear + permanent bonuses

### Level 5 — Sorcerer 5
**Gain**
- **Spell**: Lightning Bolt

**Play style (Level 5)**

- **Spell**: Haste
- **Bend Luck**: Give a target a 1d4 bonus or penalty to Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, or Ability Checks.

### Level 7 — Sorcerer 7
**Gain**
- **Spell**: Confusion

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Confusion can win fights by itself when dropped into large packs.

- **Feat**: Ability Improvement (Charisma +2)
- **Spell**: Blight

**Play style (Level 8)**

**Gain**
- **Metamagic**: Subtle Spell
- **Spell**: Cloudkill

- **Spell**: Chain Lightning
