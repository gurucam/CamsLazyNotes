## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Produce massive AoE damage by predominantly using Lightning Spells.
- Power over the elements and resistances, leaning into Lightning damage.
- Control the weather, create powerful storms, fly, and deal lightning damage with spells.

### Core Playstyle
- Nuke down entire groups on turn one by focusing on offensive area damage and Lightning/Thunder spells.
- Use Metamagic to manipulate spells (range, multiple targets, action-to-bonus action casting).
- Use Create Water to wet an area, then cast massive area Lightning damage for a combination effect (can be done on the first turn with Metamagic Quickened if you have Sorcery Points).

### Party Role
- Damage-dealer at range.
- Massive area damage.
- Crowd control support later (e.g., Confusion, Hold Monster).

### Pros
- Metamagic spell manipulation.
- Massive area damage.
- Burst damage potential is high.

### Cons
- Limited spell selection.
- Fragile.
- Sorcery Points resources / Lightning element focused.

### Power Spikes
- Level 2: Metamagic (Twinned + Distant) and Sorcery Points.
- Level 5: Level 3 spells (Lightning Bolt).
- Level 6: Heart of the Storm + resistance + Storm Spells + Haste.
- Level 11: Disintegrate + Storm’s Fury.
- Level 12: Chain Lightning + Charisma 20 via Ability Improvement.

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Storm Sorcery
  - Tempestuous Magic: After you cast a Level 1 spell or higher you can Fly as a bonus action until the end of your turn without receiving Opportunity Attacks.
  - Cantrips: Fire Bolt, Ray of Frost, Acid Splash, Shocking Grasp
  - Spells: Chromatic Orb, Mage Armour
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Chromatic Orb for small area damage; cast Mage Armour after a long rest.
    - Turn 2+: Fire Bolt for ranged damage; Shocking Grasp in melee to prevent reactions; Acid Splash to reduce armor; Ray of Frost to reduce Movement Speed by 3m if you need to flee a melee target.
  - Notes:
    - Use a Quarterstaff and stick to wearing clothing; it’s vitally important you do not use any armor on gear slots.
    - You can use spells to pump AC higher, specifically Mirror Image and Mage Armour if you have trouble with survivability.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Thunderwave
  - Sorcery Points
  - Metamagic: Twinned Spell, Distance Spell
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Twinned with Chromatic Orb for two casts on single targets early.
    - Turn 2+: Use Thunderwave for knockback (push enemies off ledges for instant kills) when pressured or going on the offensive.
  - Notes:
    - Sorcery Points can be converted into additional Spell Slots, allowing you to cast more spells in between long rests.
    - Rest a lot; you will drain spell slots quickly in this early stage.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Metamagic: Quickened Spell
  - Scorching Ray
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Quickened Spell to cast two spells in one turn (Action + Bonus Action).
    - Turn 2+: Rely on Twinned + Chromatic Orb, or Quickened + Scorching Ray if you need damage.
  - Notes:
    - Quickened Spell opens up options once you get Lightning Bolt and Fireball at levels 5 and 6.
    - Scorching Ray: Hurl 3 rays of Fire, each dealing 2d6 Fire damage at 18m range; can be cast on the same target or up to three targets.

### Level 4

  - Notes:
    - Blade Ward: Take only half of the damage from Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing attacks.
    - Misty Step: Teleport up to 18m as a bonus action.
    - Spell Sniper: Learn a cantrip; the number you need to roll a Critical Hit while attacking with a spell is reduced by 1 (can stack). This gives Eldritch Blast.

- Gain:
  - Spell: Lightning Bolt
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Lightning Bolt for massive area damage in a line.
    - Turn 2+: Position to avoid hitting allies (you are not an Evocation Wizard; allies will take damage).

  - Notes:
    - Heart of the Storm: When you cast a spell of Level 1 or higher that deals Lightning or Thunder damage, you cause a small, local storm; enemies within 6m take 3 Lightning damage or 3 Thunder damage.
    - Heart of the Storm Resistance: You are resistant to Lightning and Thunder damage.
    - Haste: Grants an additional action; requires concentration; target becomes lethargic when it ends after 10 turns.

    - Turn 1: Use Confusion for crowd control on groups.
    - Turn 2+: Continue combining single targets and area damage with crowd control as needed.

  - Spell: Hold Monster
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Hold Monster for single-target crowd control when you have a high chance to land it.
    - Turn 2+: Use area-based damage and crowd control when needing it.
  - Notes:
    - Hold Monster: Paralyze a creature; it can’t move, act, or react; attacks from within 3m are always Critical Hits.
    - Use scrolls for Mirror Image if you need defensive survivability.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Spell: Disintegrate
  - Storm’s Fury
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Pair Disintegrate with Twinned Magic to hit two targets in one cast.
    - Turn 2+: Follow up with Quickened Metamagic for another cast with your bonus action (typically an area damage spell).

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- Patch 8 marks a significant milestone for Baldur’s Gate 3, introducing a new subclass for each of the game’s 12 classes.
- One addition mentioned for Sorcerers is the Shadow Magic subclass, described as built for stealth and explosive burst damage, with the ability to see through magical darkness and synergy with spells like Darkness and Shadow Blade.
- A multiclass pairing mentioned is Hexblade Warlock to improve survivability with better armor and weapon proficiencies and shared Charisma spellcasting focus.

### Patch 7
- Overall, combat and gameplay for the Storm Sorcerer did not see any changes with the release of Patch 7 for Baldur’s Gate 3.
- The main focus of the patch and update was mod manager, in game modding tool, and evil dialogue and cut scenes; don’t expect many gameplay differences outside of new legendary actions for some bosses on honor mode difficulty.
