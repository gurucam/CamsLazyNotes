## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **hybrid melee spellcaster**: you cast Shadow Blade, wade into melee range, and combine weapon attacks with Divine Smites for devastating burst damage.
- Plays like "**get into darkness, strike with advantage, and delete priority targets**"—your damage spikes when you combine Shadow Blade's psychic damage with Paladin smites.
- You have powerful ranged options: Fireball for area damage and Counterspell for control when you can't close distance.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Cast Shadow Blade → enter melee with Eyes of the Dark: Darkness → attack with advantage → stack Divine Smites** on high-priority targets while maintaining defensive buffs like Mirror Image.

### Party role
- **Hybrid striker:** high single-target burst, decent area damage, combines melee and casting.
- **Control through darkness:** Eyes of the Dark lets you see through Darkness while enemies cannot, creating offensive and defensive advantages.
- **Utility caster:** access to buffs, debuffs, and Metamagic for flexibility.

### Pros
- Extremely high **single-target burst** with Shadow Blade + Divine Smite combo
- Can function at range or melee depending on situation
- Unique defensive option (fighting from within Darkness)
- Metamagic provides tactical flexibility

### Cons
- Slow early game (needs multiclass progression to come online)
- Complex resource management (spell slots for both spells and smites)
- Relies heavily on specific gear (Resonance Stone) and consumables
- Vulnerable when concentration breaks on Shadow Blade

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Shadow Magic subclass** + **Eyes of the Dark**
- Level 4: **Shadow Blade** spell (your core melee weapon)
- Level 6: **Fireball** (major area damage spike)
- Level 8: **Divine Smite** (turns Shadow Blade attacks into burst nukes)
- Level 11: **Extra Attack** (doubles your smite potential per turn)

---

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Half-Orc
- **Class:** Paladin (first level only)
- **Subclass:** Oath of Vengeance (Paladin), Shadow Magic (Sorcerer)
- **Background:** Entertainer
- **Skills:** Athletics, Persuasion
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 14 / INT 8 / WIS 10 / CHA 17

### Racial notes (why Half-Orc)
- **Savage Attacks** (extra damage die on crits—critical for Shadow Blade + Divine Smite burst)
- **Relentless Endurance** (survivability fail-safe when you'd drop to 0 HP)
- **Darkvision** (quality-of-life)
- **Menacing** (Intimidation proficiency fits the build)

*Secondary options mentioned in the guide:* **Zariel Tiefling** (extra Smite spell, fire resistance, Thaumaturgy) or **High Elf** (extra cantrip, specifically Booming Blade, plus weapon proficiencies).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** Start with Paladin for armor and weapon proficiencies, then multiclass into Sorcerer at level 2.
- **Armor:** Heavy armor (from Paladin level 1) allows you to ignore Dexterity for AC while maximizing Charisma.
- **Early priority:** You'll eventually use Shadow Blade (summoned weapon) as your main melee weapon, which scales off Strength or Dexterity. Use Elixir of Hill Giant Strength to boost Strength to 21, making Shadow Blade extremely powerful.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Take Paladin level 1 immediately to gain armor and weapon proficiencies that Sorcerer lacks.
- Rush to level 4 to get Shadow Blade spell—this is when melee playstyle starts working.
- In Act 2, obtain the **Resonance Stone** to double psychic damage (massive boost to Shadow Blade).
- Stock up on Elixirs of Hill Giant Strength—this build relies on them heavily.

## Level-by-level progression (Paladin 1, Sorcerer 1 → 6, Paladin 2 → 6)
> This build is resource-driven. Treat each level's **Play style** as your combat approach once resources are active.

### Level 1 — Paladin 1
**Gain**
- **Lay on Hands** (heal or cure disease using Channeled Oath charges)
- **Divine Sense** (Advantage on attacks against celestials, fiends, undead)
- **Armor Proficiency** (Light, Medium, Heavy, Shield)
- **Weapon Proficiency** (Simple, Martial)
- **Saving Throws** (Charisma, Strength)

**Subclass**
- **Oath of Vengeance**

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Standard Paladin gameplay: wear heavy armor, use martial weapons, heal as needed.
- You're setting up proficiencies for the rest of the build—Sorcerer starts next level.
- Focus on survivability and positioning in early encounters.

### Level 2 — Sorcerer 1 (Shadow Magic)
**Gain**
- **Subclass: Shadow Magic**
- **Eyes of the Dark** (see in darkness up to 24 meters)
- **Strength of the Grave** (when reduced to 0 HP, regain 1 HP instead of going down)
- **Cantrips:** Booming Blade, Fire Bolt, Ray of Frost, Shocking Grasp
- **Spells:** Shield, Thunderwave

**Play style (Level 2)**
- You're now a hybrid: use Booming Blade for melee attacks with your martial weapon.
- Shield gives you strong defensive reactions when pressured.
- Thunderwave provides knockback for melee threats or environmental kills.
- Fight in heavy armor with one-handed weapon and shield for survivability.

### Level 3 — Sorcerer 2
**Gain**
- **Sorcery Points** (can convert to spell slots or use for Metamagic)
- **Metamagic:** Careful Spell, Twinned Spell
- **Spell:** Chromatic Orb

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Twinned Spell + Chromatic Orb = cast on two targets with one action for massive early-game damage.
- Careful Spell protects allies from area effects (useful for upcoming Fireball).
- Resource management becomes important: decide when to spend Sorcery Points vs saving spell slots.

### Level 4 — Sorcerer 3
**Gain**
- **Metamagic:** Quickened Spell
- **Spells:** Shadow Blade, Invisibility (replace Thunderwave)
- **Subclass features:** Eyes of the Dark: Darkness, Darkness (cast at will)

**Play style (Level 4)**
- **Build comes online here:** Summon Shadow Blade with bonus action, attack with advantage inside your own Darkness.
- Shadow Blade hits with 2d8 psychic damage (scales with spell slot level) using Strength or Dexterity.
- Cast Eyes of the Dark: Darkness on yourself—you see through it, enemies don't. Attack with advantage while they have disadvantage hitting you.
- Use Elixir of Hill Giant Strength to boost Strength to 21 for maximum Shadow Blade damage.
- Invisibility allows surprise setups with Thunderous Smite later.

### Level 5 — Sorcerer 4
**Gain**
- **Feat:** Ability Improvement (+2 Charisma, bringing it to 19)
- **Cantrip:** Light
- **Spell:** Mirror Image

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Higher Charisma improves spell attack rolls and save DCs.
- Mirror Image adds major survivability for melee combat (+3 AC per illusion, up to 3 illusions).
- Combat loop: cast Mirror Image → summon Shadow Blade → enter Darkness → attack with advantage.
- Light cantrip helps with exploration and utility.

### Level 6 — Sorcerer 5
**Gain**
- **Spells:** Fireball, Counterspell (replace Chromatic Orb)

**Play style (Level 6)**
- **Major power spike:** Fireball provides huge area damage for grouped enemies.
- Counterspell gives you defensive utility against enemy casters.
- Two distinct modes now: melee burst (Shadow Blade) or ranged area damage (Fireball).
- Use Quickened Metamagic to cast Fireball as bonus action, allowing you to cast another spell on the same turn.
- Careful Metamagic lets you drop Fireball on allies without hurting them.

### Level 7 — Sorcerer 6
**Gain**
- **Subclass feature:** Hound of Ill Omen (summon shadow mastiff with powerful debuffs)
- **Spell:** Misty Step

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Hound of Ill Omen acts as additional pressure and control (can frighten or tangle enemies).
- Misty Step improves mobility for repositioning in/out of Darkness or escaping threats.
- Your core loop remains Shadow Blade attacks, but you have more tactical options.

### Level 8 — Paladin 2
**Gain**
- **Divine Smite** (spend spell slot on hit to add 2d8+ radiant damage)
- **Fighting Style:** Defense (+1 AC)
- **Spells:** Wrathful Smite, Thunderous Smite, Command, Divine Favor, Shield of Faith

**Play style (Level 8)**
- **Massive damage spike:** Shadow Blade attacks can now be enhanced with Divine Smite.
- Example turn: Attack with Shadow Blade (2d8 psychic) → hit → Divine Smite (2d8+ radiant) = 4d8+ damage on one hit.
- Manage spell slots carefully: you need them for both Shadow Blade concentration and Divine Smites.
- Wrathful Smite and Thunderous Smite provide bonus action smites for additional damage/control.
- Divine Smite deals extra damage to undead and fiends.

### Level 9 — Paladin 3
**Gain**
- **Subclass features:** Abjure Enemy (frighten enemy), Vow of Enmity (advantage on attacks), Bane, Hunter's Mark
- **Spell:** Cure Wounds

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Vow of Enmity on tough targets = advantage on all attacks against them (stacks with Darkness advantage for reliable hits).
- Cure Wounds provides emergency healing.
- Hunter's Mark adds 1d6 damage per hit but competes with Shadow Blade for concentration.
- Focus on single-target deletion: Vow of Enmity + Shadow Blade + Divine Smite combo.

### Level 10 — Paladin 4
**Gain**
- **Feat:** Alert (+5 initiative, can't be surprised)
- **Spells:** Bless, Lesser Restoration, Magic Weapon (drop Searing Smite if taken)

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Alert ensures you act early—critical for deleting threats before they act.
- Bless provides +1d4 to attack rolls and saves for party (strong buff).
- Magic Weapon is backup if you can't maintain Shadow Blade concentration.

### Level 11 — Paladin 5
**Gain**
- **Extra Attack** (attack twice per Attack action)
- **Subclass spells:** Hold Person, Misty Step
- **Spell:** Aid

**Play style (Level 11)**
- **Major power spike:** Two Shadow Blade attacks per turn = two opportunities for Divine Smite.
- Burst turns become absurd: Attack action (2 hits with smites) + bonus action spell = massive damage.
- Hold Person against humanoids = auto-crits on melee attacks within 3 meters (combine with smites).
- Aid increases max HP for whole party—cast before tough fights.

### Level 12 — Paladin 6
**Gain**
- **Aura of Protection** (you and nearby allies add your Charisma modifier to all saves)
- **Spell:** Protection from Poison

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Aura of Protection dramatically improves party survivability (+4 to all saves at 19 Charisma).
- Your role solidifies as hybrid striker with party support.
- Full combat loop: Mirror Image → Shadow Blade → Darkness → Vow of Enmity → Extra Attack with Divine Smites → Hound of Ill Omen for control.
- Manage resources: prioritize smites on crits, kills, or high-value targets.

# Best consumables / items (single-use)
- **Elixir of Bloodlust** — once per turn on kill: **5 temp HP** + **additional action**. Critical for burst turns: when you kill with Shadow Blade, you get another action to keep attacking or reposition. Stack these for boss fights where you can chain kills on adds.
- **Elixir of Hill Giant Strength** — sets STR to **21** (until Long Rest). This is your core damage consumable: Shadow Blade scales with Strength, so this dramatically increases your melee damage. Use one at the start of every major encounter.
- **Potion of Speed** — extra action, +2 AC, advantage on DEX saves, double movement. Turns your burst turns into deletion turns: Attack action (2 hits) + Speed action (2 hits) + bonus action smite = 4+ attacks with Divine Smite potential. Save for boss fights.
- **Elixir of Heroism** — 10 temp HP + Blessed (until Long Rest). Blessed gives +1d4 to attack rolls and saves. Extremely strong defensive and offensive buff that lasts all day. Use liberally.
- **Drow Poison** — weapon coating: CON save or becomes Poisoned/Asleep. Apply to Shadow Blade for control against tough single targets. Sleep effect can set up auto-crits.
- **Oil of Accuracy** — weapon coating: **+2 Attack Rolls**. Increases hit chance on Shadow Blade attacks. Useful against high-AC targets or when you can't get advantage.
- **Elixir of Vigilance** — **+5 initiative**; can't be Surprised. Stacks with Alert feat for +10 initiative total. Going first lets you delete threats before they act or set up Darkness before taking damage.
- **Potion of Flying** — flying speed for 1 hour. Excellent for positioning: fly above melee threats, drop Fireball from safety, or dive into Darkness cloud unreachable by ground enemies.
- **Potion of Greater Healing** — 4d4 + 4 healing. Keep multiple for emergency recovery, especially when concentrating on Shadow Blade and can't afford to drop it.

---

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
- **Luck of the Far Realms** — turn a successful hit into a Critical Hit. Combine with Shadow Blade + Divine Smite for massive burst: crit doubles all dice (Shadow Blade dice + Divine Smite dice + Savage Attacks). Use on the biggest single-target threats. This power synergizes perfectly with Hold Person (auto-crits) for absurd damage spikes.
- **Cull of the Weak** — when you bring a creature below your evolved power count in HP, it dies and nearby creatures take 1-4 Psychic damage. Excellent for cleaning up weakened enemies and spreading chip damage. Triggers passively, so it speeds up fights without requiring additional actions.
- **Psionic Backlash** — reaction: when enemy within 9m casts spell, inflict 1d4 Psychic damage per spell level. Strong against caster-heavy encounters. Doesn't require concentration, so you can keep Shadow Blade active while punishing enemy spells. 
- **Blackhole** — area pull that slows all affected targets. Requires Astral Tadpole in Act 2. Groups scattered enemies for Fireball, or pulls ranged threats into your Darkness cloud. Can be recast for free in some scenarios. Extremely powerful for large-scale boss fights with many enemies.
- **Repulsor** — massive area knockback (can hit friendlies). Environmental kill tool: use near ledges, chasms, or high ground to instantly delete groups. Be careful of friendly fire—coordinate with party positioning.
- **Charm** — force enemy to attack something else. Priority control power for redirecting dangerous enemies. Breaks concentration on enemy casters or makes melee threats attack their own allies. Doesn't cost an action if set up as reaction.

---

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- **Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer 6 → Hexblade Warlock 3 → Sorcerer 3**
  - Alternative starting path: begin with Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer for stronger synergy with Warlock multiclass.
  - At level 6, take 3 Warlock levels (Hexblade subclass) to gain medium armor, martial weapons, and different playstyle options.
  - This version is more traditional spellcaster early (robes, ranged focus) then transitions to melee-capable hybrid at level 6-8.
  - Shares Charisma as primary stat with both classes, so no ability score conflicts.
  - Final split: **Sorcerer 9 / Warlock 3** or **Sorcerer 6 / Warlock 3 / Sorcerer 3** depending on power spike preference.
  - Trades late-game Paladin support features (Aura of Protection) for Warlock invocations and Pact Boon utility.

- **Alternative Multiclass: Sorcerer 6 / Paladin 6**
  - The guide's recommended endgame split balances burst damage (Divine Smite, Extra Attack) with casting power (Fireball, Metamagic).
  
- **Alternative Multiclass: Warlock 2 / Sorcerer 6 / Paladin 4**
  - More complex option mentioned in FAQ: adds Warlock for Eldritch Blast and invocations, sacrifices some Paladin progression.
  - Best for players who want maximum flexibility and are comfortable managing three-way multiclass progression.
