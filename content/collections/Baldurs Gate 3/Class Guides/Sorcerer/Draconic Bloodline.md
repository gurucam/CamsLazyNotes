## Gameplay Tips and Tricks

  - Reach Druid Grove
  - Sell, Stock up, complete quest
  - Unlock Withers, respec to proper ability score
  - Progress to level 5
  - Reach Underdark and Grymforge
- Detailed tips:
  1. Metamagic: Always look to use this resource to cast spells multiple times.
  2. Bonus Action: Make sure to expend this with Metamagic or potion, even hide.
  3. Knockback: Use a spell-like Thunderwave to knock melee aggressors back or off ledges.
  4. Area Damage: Try to make as much area damage as possible with spells like Fireball and Chromatic Orb.
  5. Rest Constantly: Your spell slots will quickly run out after one or more fights, especially if challenging.
  6. Positioning: Always try to keep your distance so you can hit enemies and avoid needless melee damage.
  7. Crowd Control: Use your crowd control abilities when in trouble and needing to relieve pressure from you or an ally.
  8. Use Consumables: Potion of Speed gives you an additional action and can be found during the tutorial.
  9. Big Nuke: Fire off your big spell like Fireball when you can hit the maximum number of enemies.
  10. Misty Step: Save a level 2 spell in case you need to retreat via Misty Step.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer Build (Sorcerer → Warlock Hexblade → Sorcerer):
  - Start out with five levels in Sorcerer to pick up useful spells, Metamagic, and a feat.
  - In the early levels, play like a classic spellcaster: rely on ranged magic attacks, wear light robes, and stay out of melee range.
  - At Level 6, branch out by taking three levels in Warlock, with a focus on the Hexblade subclass:
    - Grants medium armor proficiency and access to martial weapons, making your character far more resilient.
    - Enables a more aggressive, melee-capable approach.
    - Synergy is strong because Sorcerer and Hexblade share reliance on Charisma as a spellcasting stat.

- Alternative Level Progression (as listed):
  - Level 1: Sorcerer — Subclass: Draconic Bloodline; Fire Bolt, Ray of Frost, Acid Splash, Shocking Grasp; Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile
  - Level 2: Sorcerer — Thunderwave; Twinned Spell; Careful Spell
  - Level 3: Sorcerer — Misty Step; Quickened Spell
  - Level 4: Sorcerer — Feat: Ability Improvement (Charisma); Friends; Scorching Ray
  - Level 5: Sorcerer — Fireball; Counterspell
  - Level 6: Warlock — Subclass: Hexblade; Eldritch Blast; Booming Blade; Wrathful Smite; Hex
  - Level 7: Warlock — Shadow Blade; Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain

  - Level 12: Sorcerer — Feat: Ability Improvement (Charisma); Cloudkill

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 introduces 12 new subclasses (one for every class in the game).
- For Sorcerers, Patch 8 brings the Shadow Magic subclass:
  - Ability to see through magical darkness and synergize it with high-damage spells like Shadow Blade.
  - A stealthy, hard-hitting caster capable of dominating close-quarters encounters while remaining unseen.
- A multiclass option discussed: Hexblade Warlock:
  - Grants access to medium armor and martial weapons, improving survivability and enabling a more aggressive, melee-capable approach.
  - Synergy is strong due to shared reliance on Charisma.

### Patch 7
- Draconic Bloodline Sorcerer combat and gameplay did not see any changes with the release of Patch 7.
- Patch 7 focus: mod manager / in game modding tool, and evil dialogue and cut scenes; don’t expect many gameplay differences outside of honor mode difficulty.
