## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- Sorcerers possess innate magical abilities and manipulate the Weave with a class mechanic, Metamagic.
- Using Metamagic, Sorcerers can add additional range, cast multiple times in a turn, and provide incredible versatility when it comes to spell casting.
- While their spell book is limited compared to that of a Wizard, their burst damage potential is high.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- Use your innate magic to cast powerful spells that deal massive area damage and control the battlefield.

### Party role
- Massive area-based damage dealer: lobbing multiple fireballs or similar massive area spells and wiping out clusters of enemies.
- Crowd control by force: disrupt and dominate encounters with high-impact spells.
- Utility caster: manipulate spells for versatility in and out of combat.

### Pros
- Metamagic Spell Manipulation
- Massive Area Damage
- Sorcery Points Resources

### Cons
- Limited Spell Selection
- Fragile
- Slow Start

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 5: Fireball (massive area damage explodes)
- Level 6: Haste (additional actions for burst turns)
- Level 8: Magic Initiate: Warlock (Eldritch Blast for consistent damage)
- Level 11: Disintegrate (extreme single-target deletion)

---

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** High Half-Elf
- **Class:** Sorcerer
- **Subclass:** Draconic Bloodline
- **Background:** Charlatan
- **Skills:** Persuasion and Insight
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 14 / INT 10 / WIS 10 / CHA 16

### Racial notes (why High Half-Elf)
- Fey Ancestry (advantage on saves against being charmed, magic can't put you to sleep)
- Darkvision (quality-of-life)
- Extra Cantrip (additional utility)

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **Human** (increased carrying capacity, skill proficiency, shield proficiency).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** Quarterstaff early (the guide highlights **Melf’s First Staff** as a strong Act 1 pickup).
- **Armor vs clothing:** you run clothing—be mindful of item interactions (e.g., passive bonuses from clothing items).
- **Back-bar ranged:** keep a ranged option like Fire Bolt equipped so you can always attack at range.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Complete the prologue, recruit companions, and stabilize your early economy (sell/stock up).
- Push to **Level 5** quickly (Fireball).
- Reach the **Underdark / Grymforge** and consider crafting **Adamantine** gear that can last deep into the game.

---

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- **Sorcerer 5 → Warlock 3 → Sorcerer 4**  
  - If you prefer a hybrid approach, the guide notes starting with five levels in Sorcerer for spells and Metamagic, then three in Hexblade Warlock for medium armor and melee capability, finishing in Sorcerer for high-level spells.  
- **Sorcerer 12 (recommended)**  
  - The guide’s endgame preference is pure Sorcerer for maximum spellcasting power and burst potential.
