## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Wild Magic favors randomness and adds flair with wild magic that can change the effect of your spells.
- Wild Magic stems from the forces of chaos. It churns within the sorcerers who wield it, waiting to burst free.
- Intended for dishing out massive area-based damage.

### Core Playstyle
- Lobbing multiple fireballs or similar massive area spells and wiping out mobs.

### Party Role
- Range DPS.
- Massive area-based damage.

### Pros
- Burst damage potential is higher.
- Using Metamagic, Sorcerers can add additional range, cast multiple times in a turn, and provide incredible versatility when it comes to spell casting.
- Wild Magic also boosts any elemental damage, so you’re free to experiment with your favorite spells.

### Cons
- Their spell book is limited compared to a Wizard.
- Spellcasters in BG3 feel weak in the first several levels.

### Power Spikes
- Level 5: access to Level 3 spells (Fireball) and starts to feel very powerful.
- Level 6: Haste and Fireball combination to wipe out groups on turn one; Bend Luck unlock.
- Level 11: access level 6 spells (Disintegrate) and Controlled Chaos.

## Alternative Build Route
For this alternative Sorcerer Build we’ll be starting out with the Draconic Bloodline subclass at Level 1. This means you won’t be using the Wild Magic subclass, but Draconic Bloodline simply synergizes more effectively with Warlock. At the beginning this build will be primarily spellcasting focused, with the traditional magic playstyle. You’ll be wearing robes, and staying at range to deal damage and keep away from attacks.

At Level 6, we recommend investing three levels into the Warlock class, specifically choosing the Hexblade subclass. This choice significantly broadens your character’s capabilities. You’ll gain medium armor proficiency and become proficient with martial weapons, allowing for a more durable front-line presence. With these new proficiencies, your character can equip heavier armor for better protection and even lean into a melee-oriented playstyle, adding versatility to your combat approach.

Level Class Selection
- 1 Sorcerer: Subclass: Draconic Bloodline, Fire Bolt, Ray of Frost, Acid Splash, Shocking Grasp, Chromatic Orb, Magic Missile
- 2 Sorcerer: Thunderwave, Twinned Spell, Careful Spell
- 3 Sorcerer: Misty Step, Quickened Spell
- 4 Sorcerer: Feat: Ability Improvement Charisma, Friends, Scorching Ray
- 5 Sorcerer: Fireball, Counterspell
- 6 Warlock: Subclass: Hexblade, Eldritch Blast, Booming Blade, Wrathful Smite, Hex
- 7 Warlock: Shadow Blade, Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain
- 8 Warlock: Mage Hand, Darkness
- 9 Sorcerer: Haste
- 10 Sorcerer: Blight
- 11 Sorcerer: Banishment
- 12 Sorcerer: Feat: Ability Improvement Charisma, Cloudkill

## Patch Changes
### Patch 8
- Patch 8 marks a major milestone for Baldur’s Gate 3, introducing a new subclass for every class, which means 12 in total.
- Sorcerers gain access to the Shadow Magic subclass.
- The build page has been updated for the Patch 8 version of Baldur’s Gate 3.

### Patch 7
- Wild Magic Sorcerer combat and gameplay did not see any changes with the release of Patch 7 for Baldur’s Gate 3.
- The main focus of the patch and update was mod manager, in game modding tool, and evil dialogue and cut scenes.
- Don’t expect many gameplay differences outside of new legendary actions for some bosses in Honor Mode difficulty.
