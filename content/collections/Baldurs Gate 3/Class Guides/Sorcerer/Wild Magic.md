## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- This is a highly unpredictable, pure spellcaster build that specializes in **massive area-based damage** and battlefield control.
- The Wild Magic subclass adds a dangerous, high-risk, high-reward element to every encounter, allowing for huge power spikes or hilarious chaos.
- The core fantasy is to use powerful elemental spells and manipulate them with Metamagic to either hit multiple targets or deal maximum single-target damage with unpredictable (but often beneficial) surges.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Manipulate your spell slot economy** using Sorcery Points, leverage the unpredictability of **Wild Magic** to spike damage, and overwhelm groups of enemies with powerful, modified spells.

### Party role
- **Primary Area-of-Effect (AoE) Damage Dealer:** High-threat caster focused on clearing groups of enemies and exploiting elemental weaknesses.
- **Utility Support:** Can use Metamagic like *Twinned Spell* for powerful single-target buffs or use *Bend Luck* to adjust dice rolls.

---

## Character creation

### Race
- **High Half-Elf**: Grants an additional Cantrip (like Fire Bolt) that uses Charisma for casting, which is your primary stat. The extra shield proficiency is also a nice durability boost.
- **Asmodeus Tiefling**: Provides Darkvision and access to the *Hellish Rebuke* spell, giving you a powerful reaction damage option.

### Starting stats (Recommended spread)
- **Primary:** Charisma (CHA)
- **Secondary:** Constitution (CON)
- **Tertiary:** Dexterity (DEX)

| Stat | Value | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **STR** | 8 | Dump stat, as you are a pure caster. |
| **DEX** | 14 | Improves AC and Initiative. |
| **CON** | 15 | Improves HP and Concentration Saves, critical for casters. |
| **INT** | 10 | Can be useful for certain checks, but not a priority. |
| **WIS** | 10 | Useful for common saving throws. |
| **CHA** | 17 | **Your primary spellcasting ability; max this first.** |

*Note: The 15 CON and 17 CHA assume you will take the **Auntie Ethel's Hair** permanent bonus to reach 18 CHA early.*

### Skill proficiencies
- **Arcana** (INT): Useful for identifying magical items and lore checks.
- **Persuasion** (CHA): High Charisma makes you the party face.
- **Intimidation** (CHA): An aggressive dialogue option for your high Charisma.

### Background
- **Sage**: Grants proficiency in Arcana and History, fitting the magical scholarly flavor.
- **Noble**: Provides Persuasion and History, leaning into the role of the party's Charisma face.

## Level-by-level progression (Sorcerer 1 → 12)

### Level 1

#### GAIN
- Class: Sorcerer (Spells and Cantrips unlocked)
- Feature: **Sorcery Points**
- Subclass: **Wild Magic**
- Subclass Feature: **Tides of Chaos** (Advantage on Attack Roll, Ability Check, or Saving Throw)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 1)
- **Prioritize:** Getting a kill or dealing high damage to a group using your Cantrips, as your spell slots are extremely limited. *Magic Missile* is reliable.
- **Resource Spending:** Use **Tides of Chaos** immediately on an important attack or check. This *guarantees* your next leveled spell will trigger a Wild Magic Surge.
- **Typical Turn:** Cast a Cantrip, move, and use Tides of Chaos when you need a critical success outside of combat.

### Level 2

#### GAIN
- Feature: **Metamagic** (2 choices)
  - **Twinned Spell** (Cost: 1 Sorcery Point per Spell Level)
  - **Quickened Spell** (Cost: 3 Sorcery Points)
- Spell Slots: Level 1 and 2

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 2)
- **Prioritize:** Leveraging Metamagic. This is your power spike. Use **Quickened Spell** to cast a powerful damaging spell as a bonus action, freeing up your action for a Cantrip or dash.
- **Resource Spending:** **Twinned Spell** is excellent for single-target buffs like *Haste* or *Invisibility* on two characters instead of one. **Quickened Spell** is your primary damage booster for burst turns.
- **Typical Turn:** Cast *Chromatic Orb* (Level 1 spell) using **Quickened Spell** (Bonus Action), then follow up with *Ray of Frost* (Action).

### Level 3

#### GAIN
- Subclass Feature: **Bend Luck** (Reaction)
- Spell Slots: Level 2 (new max)
- Spells: Level 2 spells unlocked (*Cloud of Daggers* or *Misty Step*)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 3)
- **Prioritize:** Using **Bend Luck** as a reaction to assist allies or hinder enemies on attack rolls, saving throws, or ability checks. This feature helps smooth out the natural variance of the D20 system.
- **Resource Spending:** Use your Level 2 slots on powerful new utility spells. *Misty Step* is invaluable for positioning and escaping danger.
- **Typical Turn:** Position well using movement or *Misty Step*, then use a Metamagic-enhanced spell to clear grouped targets. Save your reaction for *Bend Luck*.

### Level 4

#### GAIN
- Feat: **Spell Sniper**
- Spell Slots: Level 2 (max 3 slots)
- New Cantrip and Spell

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 4)
- **Prioritize:** Taking the **Spell Sniper** feat. This reduces the required roll for a critical hit with Cantrips, making your free-to-cast spells far more deadly.
- **Resource Spending:** Lean into high-damage Cantrips like *Fire Bolt* or *Ray of Frost*. The increased crit range makes Cantrips reliable damage sources when you need to conserve slots.
- **Typical Turn:** If slots are low, use an enhanced Cantrip with a higher crit chance. If a critical check is needed, you still have **Tides of Chaos** ready.

### Level 5

#### GAIN
- Spell Slots: Level 3 (new max)
- Spells: Level 3 spells unlocked (*Fireball* or *Haste*)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 5)
- **Prioritize:** The **Fireball** spike. This is the moment the build truly begins to realize its AoE damage potential. Use **Twinned Spell** on *Haste* to buff two allies at once for massive combat advantage.
- **Resource Spending:** Use Level 3 slots primarily for *Fireball* against groups. If you triggered a Wild Magic Surge on a prior turn, leverage the ongoing effect.
- **Typical Turn:** Open combat with a *Fireball* or *Haste* (Twinned). Use *Fireball* from a safe distance to hit maximum targets.

### Level 6

#### GAIN
- Subclass Feature: **Controlled Chaos**
- Spell Slots: Level 3 (max 3 slots)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 6)
- **Prioritize:** **Controlled Chaos** allows you to re-roll a Wild Magic Surge once per Long Rest. This is key to mitigating the few truly detrimental random effects and fishing for the best outcomes.
- **Resource Spending:** Feel more confident in triggering Wild Magic Surges using Tides of Chaos, as you now have a fail-safe against the worst outcomes (like self-damage or teleporting away allies).
- **Typical Turn:** Use Tides of Chaos, cast a leveled spell, and if the Surge is bad, immediately use Controlled Chaos to try for a better one.

### Level 7

#### GAIN
- Spell Slots: Level 4 (new max)
- Spells: Level 4 spells unlocked (*Ice Storm* or *Wall of Fire*)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 7)
- **Prioritize:** Experimenting with high-level AoE control and damage spells. *Ice Storm* and *Wall of Fire* offer excellent area denial.
- **Resource Spending:** Level 4 slots should be used to control the battlefield or deal massive elemental damage to tough enemies. Focus on elemental weaknesses.
- **Typical Turn:** Use a Level 4 spell to shape the combat arena, ensuring enemies are caught in dangerous zones or bottlenecks.

### Level 8

#### GAIN
- Feat: **Ability Improvement (ASI)**
- Spell Slots: Level 4 (max 3 slots)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 8)
- **Prioritize:** Maxing out **Charisma** from 18 to 20 with the Ability Improvement. This directly increases your spell attack rolls, spell save DC, and the potency of your Sorcerer abilities.
- **Resource Spending:** Every spell is now significantly more likely to succeed. This is a pure power boost. Continue using **Quickened Spell** to cast your most powerful damage spell as a bonus action.
- **Typical Turn:** Full offense, utilizing the highest possible spell DC to ensure critical enemies fail their saving throws against your most potent spells.

### Level 9

#### GAIN
- Spell Slots: Level 5 (new max)
- Spells: Level 5 spells unlocked (*Cone of Cold* or *Synaptic Static*)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 9)
- **Prioritize:** The sheer damage of Level 5 spells. *Cone of Cold* is a reliable, high-burst damage option.
- **Resource Spending:** Convert lower-level spell slots into Sorcery Points to maintain a high pool for Quickened and Twinned Spell usage. Level 5 slots are for encounters that absolutely must end quickly.
- **Typical Turn:** Use *Cone of Cold* (Twinned if possible, on two close targets) to end a difficult fight in one turn.

### Level 10

#### GAIN
- Metamagic: **2 New Choices** (total 4)
  - **Careful Spell** (Cost: 1 Sorcery Point)
  - **Heightened Spell** (Cost: 3 Sorcery Points)
- Spell Slots: Level 5 (max 3 slots)
- New Cantrip

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 10)
- **Prioritize:** The new Metamagic. **Careful Spell** is vital for AoE casters, allowing you to exempt allies from the effects of spells like *Fireball*. **Heightened Spell** gives disadvantage on the saving throw, ensuring your highest-stakes spells land on bosses.
- **Resource Spending:** Use **Careful Spell** on every AoE spell where an ally might be caught. Save **Heightened Spell** for boss fights to guarantee the saving throw fails.
- **Typical Turn:** Cast a *Fireball* (Careful Spell) into a dense group, including allies, then follow up with a strong Cantrip.

### Level 11

#### GAIN
- Spell Slots: Level 6 (new max)
- Spells: Level 6 spells unlocked (*Disintegrate* or *Chain Lightning*)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 11)
- **Prioritize:** **Chain Lightning** is your ultimate multi-target damage spell, ensuring high damage on multiple enemies without needing to group them tightly. *Disintegrate* is your ultimate single-target spell.
- **Resource Spending:** Only use Level 6 slots for the most critical threats, as you only get one per Long Rest. Use *Chain Lightning* when facing disparate groups and *Disintegrate* for single-target elimination.
- **Typical Turn:** Use **Heightened Spell** + *Disintegrate* on the boss, or a Quickened Level 3 spell + *Chain Lightning* (Action) to clear the entire room.

### Level 12

#### GAIN
- Feat: **Elemental Adept (Fire or Lightning)**
- Spell Slots: Level 6 (max 2 slots)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 12)
- **Prioritize:** The **Elemental Adept** feat. This ensures your spells cannot be resisted by enemies and guarantees a minimum damage roll, massively increasing the consistency and raw power of your core damage spells (e.g., *Fireball*, *Chain Lightning*). Choose the element you use most often.
- **Resource Spending:** This is the final form of the build. Use all your Metamagic and high-level slots aggressively, knowing your elemental damage is maximized and highly reliable.
- **Typical Turn:** Focus on casting your highest-level AoE spell (Careful- or Heightened-Metamagic applied) to end the fight.

# Best consumables / items (single-use)

- **Elixir of Bloodlust** — *Once per turn on kill: **5 temp HP** + **additional action***
  - **What it does:** Grants an extra Action upon downing an enemy.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** This build excels at AoE damage and securing kills. This elixir turns the Sorcerer into a killing machine, allowing them to cast two high-level spells in one turn (via Quickened Spell and the extra action) or to finish off a group with a powerful spell and then reposition/buff.
  - **When to use it:** Ideal for encounters with high enemy density or for crucial burst turns against multiple tough targets.

- **Potion of Speed** — *Extra action, +2 AC, advantage on DEX saves, double movement*
  - **What it does:** Grants an additional Action and several defensive bonuses for two turns.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** The extra action is the most important part, allowing for a three-spell turn (Quickened + Action + Potion Action) or a massive defensive cast/reposition combo. The +2 AC helps with the Sorcerer’s naturally low Armor Class.
  - **When to use it:** Reserve for boss fights or difficult encounters where maximizing damage in the first two rounds is critical to winning the fight quickly.

- **Elixir of Vigilance** — ***+5 initiative**; can’t be Surprised*
  - **What it does:** Provides a large bonus to Initiative and immunity to being Surprised.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** Going first is paramount for an AoE damage dealer. It allows the Sorcerer to drop a devastating spell (*Fireball*, *Chain Lightning*) before the enemies can spread out, close the distance, or use their own concentration spells.
  - **When to use it:** Should be used daily (until Long Rest) to ensure the Sorcerer acts at the top of the combat order in almost every encounter.

- **Oil of Accuracy** — *Weapon coating: **+2 Attack Rolls***
  - **What it does:** Increases the Attack Roll bonus of a weapon by +2.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** While the Sorcerer is not a martial class, some spells (*Ray of Frost*, *Disintegrate*) require an Attack Roll. This oil increases the chance of these powerful, single-target elimination spells connecting.
  - **When to use it:** Apply before boss fights or against high-AC enemies where guaranteeing a hit with a spell like *Disintegrate* is a priority.

---

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)

- **Luck of the Far Realms** — *Turn a successful hit into a Critical Hit (once per Long Rest)*
  - **What it does:** Allows the caster to guarantee a critical hit on any successful attack roll.
  - **Why it synergizes with the build:** The Wild Magic Sorcerer frequently uses attack roll Cantrips (like *Ray of Frost*, especially with Spell Sniper) and powerful single-target spells like *Disintegrate*. Using this power ensures that a high-level, high-damage spell deals double damage, guaranteeing the swift removal of a primary threat. It is the ultimate insurance for a single-target elimination.

- **Cull of the Weak** — *Execute low-HP enemies; nearby creatures take Psychic damage*
  - **What it does:** When you reduce a creature’s HP to 0, enemies within a short radius take Psychic damage equal to the number of tadpoles consumed.
  - **Why it synergizes with the build:** This power doubles down on the build’s AoE focus. The Sorcerer’s goal is to decimate groups of enemies with *Fireball* or *Chain Lightning*. This power makes every kill count, effectively adding a secondary wave of passive AoE damage and helping to snowball the fight by cleaning up low-health mobs after a large spell hit.

- **Psionic Backlash** — *Reaction Psychic damage when an enemy casts a spell*
  - **What it does:** Allows you to use a Reaction to deal high Psychic damage to an enemy when they cast a spell.
  - **Why it synergizes with the build:** This adds a crucial element of counterplay against enemy casters, which are often the most dangerous targets. As a Sorcerer, your reaction is frequently free. This provides a high-damage, resource-efficient way to punish enemy concentration and spellcasting, making you a threat even during the enemy's turn.

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- **Pure Sorcerer (1 → 12)**
  - The guide notes that a single-class Sorcerer is the most optimal route for spell progression and hitting maximum Charisma quickly. No major alternative multiclass option is suggested, as the primary goal is rapid access to Level 6 spell slots.
