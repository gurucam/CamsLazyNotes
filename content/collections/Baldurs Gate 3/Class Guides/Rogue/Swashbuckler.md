## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A flashy, aggressive Rogue that plays **in melee range** instead of living in stealth: you weave in and out of enemies, land Sneak Attacks reliably, and use dirty tricks to control the fight.
- The Swashbuckler makes Sneak Attack **much easier** in close quarters, and its kit rewards high Dexterity with a social / charismatic edge.
- The guide’s “optimized” approach shifts into Fighter for Extra Attack and additional feats, turning you into a relentless duelist who stays dangerous even when stealth openings aren’t available.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Get into 1.5m melee range, land consistent Sneak Attacks, and use bonus-action Dirty Tricks to disarm or blind whatever would ruin your turn.**

### Party role
- **Melee damage dealer:** consistent Sneak Attack uptime in melee range.
- **Control support:** bonus-action disarm / blind, plus utility spells if you take the Eldritch Knight route.
- **Face/utility Rogue:** Sleight of Hand + Stealth + Charisma skills for dialogue and exploration.

### Pros
- Auto Sneak Attack in melee range (simple, reliable damage loop)
- Strong combat utility from Dirty Tricks
- Multiclass scaling: Extra Attack + more feats for big endgame power

### Cons
- Melee-focused (you’re closer to danger than most Rogue builds)
- Multiclass needed for optimal performance (per the guide)
- Dirty Trick features scale with Charisma (split stat pressure)

### Power spikes to look forward to
- **Level 2:** Cunning Action (movement + survivability)
- **Level 3:** Swashbuckler unlocks (Rakish Audacity + Fancy Footwork)
- **Level 4:** Dirty Tricks + feat (Dual Wielder recommended)
- **Level 6:** Action Surge (short-rest burst)
- **Level 9:** Extra Attack (sustained damage)
- **Level 10:** Alert (go first, set tempo)
- **Level 12:** Savage Attacker (better melee damage rolls)

## Character creation

### Race choice (from the guide)
- **High Elf** is recommended because you gain Longbow/Longsword proficiency, Darkvision, Fey Ancestry, and **1 cantrip**. The guide calls out Patch 8’s **Booming Blade** cantrip as a major reason this race is “best in slot” for the build.

### Starting setup
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** High Elf
- **Class:** Rogue
- **Subclass:** Swashbuckler (unlocked at Rogue level 3)
- **Background:** Urchin
- **Cantrip:** Booming Blade
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 17 / CON 16 / INT 10 / WIS 8 / CHA 14
- **Saving Throws:** Dexterity and Intelligence
- **Armor:** Light Armour
- **Weapons:** Simple Weapons, Hand Crossbows, Longswords, Rapiers, Shortswords

### Skill priorities (from the guide)
- Prioritize a mix of dialogue + Rogue utility:
  - **Sleight of Hand**
  - **Stealth**
  - **Persuasion**
  - **Intimidation**
  - (and other Charisma skills if you want roleplay flexibility)

### Ability score notes (from the guide)
- The guide emphasizes **17 Dexterity** (primary), **16 Constitution** (survivability), and **14 Charisma** (subclass features + dialogue).
- Dexterity starts odd at 17 with the assumption you can obtain **Auntie Ethel’s Hair** in Act 1 to hit 18, then later reach 20 with a feat (and potentially the Mirror of Loss in Act 3).

## Level-by-level progression (Rogue 1 → 4, Fighter 1 → 8)
> This build is melee-forward. Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop.

### Level 1 — Rogue 1
**Gain**
- Sneak Attack (Ranged & Melee)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- In early fights, you can still open from stealth when it’s convenient, but don’t overthink it: your job is to land Sneak Attack reliably.
- If you’re in melee, keep an ally near your target (or position smartly) so Sneak Attack conditions are easy to meet.
- When you can’t safely stay in melee, step back, reset positioning, and take a ranged Sneak Attack instead.

### Level 2 — Rogue 2
**Gain**
- Cunning Action: Hide
- Cunning Action: Dash
- Cunning Action: Disengage

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Use bonus action **Disengage** to avoid getting pinned; you want to choose your targets, not get stuck trading.
- Dash is your “stay on the priority target” tool when movement is the difference between a dead enemy and a wasted turn.
- Hide is still valuable for opening fights or breaking line of sight, but you’re not a pure stealth build—use it when it helps, not every turn.

### Level 3 — Rogue 3 (Swashbuckler)
**Gain**
- Subclass: Swashbuckler
- Fancy Footwork: if you make a melee attack against a target, that target can’t make Opportunity Attacks against you for the rest of your turn
- Rakish Audacity: +2 bonus to initiative (scales with Rogue level); you no longer need Advantage to trigger Sneak Attack as long as you are within 1.5m / 5ft of the target and don’t have Disadvantage

**Play style (Level 3)**
- This is where the build “clicks”: get into **1.5m melee range** and you can Sneak Attack much more easily.
- Use Fancy Footwork to hit, then reposition without eating opportunity attacks—your turns should feel mobile and controlled.
- Pick targets that can’t punish you heavily on reaction; you’re a duelist, not a tank.

### Level 4 — Rogue 4
**Gain**
- Dirty Tricks (subclass feature; Charisma is the modifier):
  - Dirty Trick: Flick o’ the Wrist (possibly Disarm)
  - Dirty Trick: Sand Toss (possibly Blind)
  - Dirty Trick: Vicious Mockery (cantrip at will)
- Feat recommendation: Dual Wielder (lets you equip two non-heavy weapons such as Longswords or Rapiers; +1 AC in Light Armour)
- (Alternative mentioned): Ability Score Improvement +2 Dexterity if you stick with shortswords/daggers

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Your bonus action becomes “meaningful”: disarm weapon users with Flick o’ the Wrist, blind casters with Sand Toss, then keep stabbing.
- Dual Wielder opens up weapon choices—your melee kit feels smoother when both hands are real weapons.
- Try to end turns in a safe spot: you want to stay in melee range on your terms, not because you got trapped there.

### Level 5 — Fighter 1
**Gain**
- Multiclass: Fighter (recommended by the guide)
- Second Wind (bonus-action self heal)
- Fighting Style note: Two-Weapon Fighting style is mentioned as a key pickup for off-hand damage

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Second Wind is a big quality-of-life change: you can heal without sacrificing your action.
- You’re starting to feel like a “real” melee carry—still prioritize Sneak Attack, but you can brawl longer.
- Keep Dirty Tricks for the turns when control matters more than raw damage.

### Level 6 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- Action Surge (extra action; recharges on Short Rest)

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Action Surge is your burst button: use it to finish a priority target before they act again or to recover a bad turn.
- A clean pattern: open strong → Action Surge to secure the kill → keep moving so you’re not surrounded.
- Don’t hoard it forever; short rests are common and this is why you multiclassed.

### Level 7 — Fighter 3
**Gain**
- Fighter subclass selection: Eldritch Knight (recommended in the guide text for simplicity and damage)
- Cantrips / spells mentioned:
  - Booming Blade (if you didn’t already take it via race)
  - Bursting Sinew (cantrip)
  - Shield (spell)
  - Thunderwave (spell)
  - Longstrider (expanded spell)

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Your melee turns get a “magic edge”: weave in Booming Blade when it fits your plan, especially when you expect enemies to move.
- Shield helps you survive the moments where melee pressure spikes—use it to avoid losing tempo.
- Longstrider is an easy win for positioning: more movement means more control over who you hit and when.

### Level 8 — Fighter 4
**Gain**
- Feat: +2 Dexterity
- Note: if you completed Auntie Ethel’s Hair in Act 1, this can reach 20 (and you can increase Dex by +2 in Act 3 with Mirror of Loss)
- Spell: Magic Mirror (mentioned)

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Higher Dexterity makes everything feel cleaner: AC, initiative, hit chance, and damage consistency.
- Use your mobility to keep fights “one target at a time”—you don’t want to be trading with three enemies at once.
- If your positioning is bad, fix it immediately; this build wins by staying proactive.

### Level 9 — Fighter 5
**Gain**
- Extra Attack (two attacks with one action)

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Extra Attack is the “you now scale” moment: you can apply pressure every turn even when Sneak Attack isn’t perfect.
- A good turn feels like: pick a target → apply control if needed → swing twice and keep the enemy from stabilizing.
- Keep your bonus action reserved for Dirty Tricks when it matters; otherwise, off-hand damage stays valuable.

### Level 10 — Fighter 6
**Gain**
- Feat: Alert (+5 initiative; can’t be Surprised)

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Alert lets you set the tempo: you go early, you choose who loses their turn, and you stop ambushes from deleting you.
- If you can remove one enemy immediately, do it—snowballing early is how melee Rogues stay safe.
- You’re now a “first-turn problem solver,” not just a damage dealer.

### Level 11 — Fighter 7
**Gain**
- (From the guide table): Remarkable Athlete: Proficiency and Jump
- (From the guide text): “your subclass gives you two level-two spells” with recommendations:
  - Darkness
  - Scorching Ray

**Play style (Level 11)**
- When a fight gets messy, this is where your utility spells can swing it—use them when a normal stab plan won’t hold.
- If you can create advantage, deny enemy sightlines, or force bad positioning, do it—then go back to clean melee pressure.
- Stay disciplined: you’re still a weapon build first; spells are your “this turn must change” tools.

### Level 12 — Fighter 8
**Gain**
- Feat: Savage Attacker (melee attacks roll damage dice twice and use the highest)
- Spell options mentioned:
  - Shadow Blade (if you want to use a one-handed weapon and shield)
  - Mirror Image (for dual wield)

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Savage Attacker makes your melee output more consistent—your best turns are now very reliable.
- Choose Shadow Blade vs Mirror Image based on what you need: more offense with a shield route, or more safety while dual wielding.
- Your endgame goal is simple: go first, control what matters, and delete targets in melee without getting stuck.

# Best consumables / items (single-use)

These consumables are highlighted by the guide as key power multipliers. Your build scales extremely well with **extra actions, mobility, and burst windows**, so treat these as part of your “real” kit, not optional extras.

- **Elixir of Bloodlust**
  - Once per turn when you kill a foe, you gain **HP 5 temporary hit points** and **an additional action**.
  - Best used in fights with multiple enemies where you can secure an early kill and immediately snowball.

- **Elixir of Hill Giant Strength**
  - Increases Strength ability score to **21** until Long Rest.
  - Particularly valuable when your weapon can scale with Strength or Dexterity (the guide calls out endgame Strength elixir usage).

- **Potion of Speed**
  - Gain extra action, **+2 AC**, Advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws, and double movement speed.
  - Use for boss fights, hard openers, or any fight where going first and deleting a target wins the encounter.

- **Drow Poison**
  - Weapon poison that adds Constitution Saving Throw or becomes Poisoned and falls Asleep.
  - Great for shutting down a dangerous enemy when you need control without spending actions on a spell.

- **Potion of Flying**
  - Drink to gain a flying speed of **60ft for one hour**.
  - Solves positioning in melee: reach priority targets, ignore terrain, and keep pressure without wasting turns.

- **Elixir of Heroism**
  - Gain **10 temp HP** and become **Blessed** until a long rest.
  - Strong “all-day” buff that improves reliability and survivability across multiple fights.

- **Potion of Greater Healing**
  - **4d4 + 4** hit points restored.
  - Your emergency reset so you can stay aggressive instead of backing off.

- **Oil of Accuracy**
  - Coat Weapon. Bonus of **+2 in Attack Rolls**.
  - Excellent on turns where you absolutely must land hits (especially into high-AC targets).

- **Elixir of Vigilance**
  - Drink to gain a **+5 bonus to Initiative** and you can’t be Surprised.
  - Fits the build’s “set tempo first” plan, especially combined with Alert.

---

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)

The guide calls out these Illithid powers as best-in-slot for Swashbuckler, focusing on critical-hit burst, executes, caster punishment, and big fight control.

- **Luck of the Far Realms**
  - When you make a successful Attack Roll against a foe, you can change that hit into a **Critical Hit**.
  - Use this to force a massive burst moment when a target must die immediately.

- **Cull the Weak**
  - When you bring a creature down to fewer hit points than your number of evolved illithid powers, it dies and all nearby creatures take **1–4 Psychic damage**.
  - Great for converting “almost dead” into a clean execute and for chaining kill momentum.

- **Psionic Backlash**
  - When an enemy within **9m** casts a spell, you can use your reaction to inflict **1d4 Psychic damage** to the caster per the spell’s level.
  - Helps punish casters while you keep your action for melee pressure.

- **Blackhole**
  - Area-based suck-in that slows targets.
  - Requires the Astral Tadpole in Act 2 (per the guide), and is best for large fights where grouping enemies wins the encounter.

- **Repulsor**
  - Massive area knockback that can hit friendlies.
  - Your emergency “reset the battlefield” button when melee becomes unsafe or you need to peel threats off allies.

- **Charm**
  - The guide flags this as a priority power because you can force enemies to attack something else.
  - Use it to redirect pressure away from your party (or off you when you’re committed in melee range).

---

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- At level 5 and beyond, the guide recommends multiclassing to **Fighter** because Rogue “suffers from weak bonuses,” and Fighter provides a fighting style, Extra Attack, and multiple features that boost combat performance.
- **Alternatively, you can multiclass to Warlock**: the guide notes **1–4 levels of Warlock** can boost damage, but you will **lack Extra Attack unless you take Warlock to level 5**. If you do, select **Hexblade** and boost your Charisma with a feat.
