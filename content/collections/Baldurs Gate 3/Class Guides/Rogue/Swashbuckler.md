## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- A thematic Rogue build focused on Dexterity and Charisma, letting you “talk your way out of combat or engage.”
- Emphasizes melee combat and makes Sneak Attack damage much easier with an overall simple build.
- Increased mobility and flair, allowing Rogues to slip in and out of stealth with agility and style.

### Core Playstyle
- Fight in melee range to take advantage of automatic Sneak Attack, using Dirty Trick bonus actions to control enemies, and multiclassing into Fighter for a major combat performance boost.

### Party Role
- Utility: sneaking, lockpicking, pickpocketing, and general non-combat usage.
- Melee damage dealer that can be a potent combatant.
- Dialogue/role-play presence via higher Charisma than other Rogue builds.

### Pros
- Utility in Combat
- Thematic Build
- Auto Sneak Attack

### Cons
- Melee Focused
- Multiclass Needed
- Charisma Subclass Features

### Power Spikes

- Level 4: Dirty Tricks unlocked; Dual Wielder opens more weapon options and +1 AC in Light Armour.
- Level 5+: Multiclass to Fighter for a “much-needed performance boost in combat.”
- Level 6: Action Surge (replenishes on short rest) for an extra action in a turn.
- Level 9: Extra Attack (two attacks with one action).
- Reach Level 6: “your power dramatically increases.”

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Sneak Attack (Ranged & Melee): Deal an additional 1d6 damage to an enemy you have an Advantage against. To gain Advantage, you need to be hiding or an ally to be within 1.5 meters of the enemy.
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - The Rogue doesn’t gain much outside of Sneak Attack; you gain your subclass at level 3 so “expect a slow start.”
    - If you chose the Half-Elf race, rely on Booming Blade cantrip in melee and finding a ranged weapon during the tutorial.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Cunning Action: Hide
  - Cunning Action: Dash
  - Cunning Action: Disengage
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Cunning actions help your movement and survivability.
    - Equip dual wield shortswords or daggers at this point with a Longbow on ranged weapon if Half Elf.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Swashbuckler
  - Fancy Footwork: If you make a melee attack against a target, that target can’t make Opportunity Attacks against you for the rest of your turn.
  - Rakish Audacity: You gain a +2 bonus to initiative rolls (scales with rogue level). You no longer need Advantage to trigger Sneak Attack as long as you are within 1.5 m / 5 ft of the target and don’t have Disadvantage.
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Rakish Audacity gives you an incentive to play in melee range; make sure you have dual wielding weapons.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Dirty Tricks (subclass feature): Charisma is the spellcasting modifier used for these abilities.
    - Dirty Trick: Flick o’ the Wrist: possibly Disarm them.
    - Dirty Trick: Sand Toss: possibly Blind them.
    - Dirty Trick: Vicious Mockery: Cast as a cantrip at will.

  - Notes:
    - Dirty Trick allows you to use a bonus action for an effect on the target.
    - “The two best choices are Flick o’ the Wrist and Sand Toss.” When fighting a weapon user, Flick o’ the Wrist; when fighting magic-users, Sand Toss.
    - Alternative: Ability Score Improvement +2 Dexterity if you stick with shortswords and daggers.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Multiclass recommendation: Fighter (recommended because Rogue suffers from weak bonuses at level 5 and beyond).
  - Second Wind: “a very powerful self-heal immediately” using a bonus action, letting you heal and attack in one turn.
  - Two Weapon Fighting Style: When you make an offhand attack, you can add your Ability Score Modifier to the damage of the attack.
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Multiclassing to Fighter is highly recommended for a performance boost in combat (Fighting Style, Extra Attack, and other features).
    - Alternative multiclass mentioned: Warlock (1–4 levels to boost damage, but lacks extra attack unless taken to level 5; if so, select Hexblade and boost Charisma with feat).

### Level 6

- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Use Action Surge for an extra action in a turn.

    - “Now, use Booming Blade with your attack to get extra thunder damage.”

### Level 8

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Play in melee range to take advantage of the automatic sneak attack subclass feature.
- Use the Dirty Trick bonus action to disarm enemies or blind them if they are spellcasters.
- Use piercing weapons like Crimson Mischief, Bloodthirst, daggers and shortswords in combination with Bhaalist Armour for double damage.
- Loot Everything: You will need a lot of gold to buy consumables, potions, and ammunition so loot and sell constantly.
- Crafting: Elixirs and potions are vital, and you need to purchase materials when trading for crafting.
- Reach Level 6: Spend the early part of the game completing every quest to reach level 6 where your power dramatically increases.
- Sell Often: Your carrying capacity will be limited so sell often, and store excessive items in your traveler’s chest.
- Stealth: Start combat in stealth if at all possible to trigger the Surprise status effect.
- Consider Illithid Powers: While it can come with an altered appearance, the powers are powerful and can help you.
- Oils + Elixiris: Combine both oils/coatings and Elixir during combat for a dual benefit.
- Persuasion: Try to avoid combat through dialogue if possible.
- Best tip: selecting a High Elf race to gain Longbow, Longsword proficiency, and Booming Blade Cantrip; then multiclass to a Fighter at level 5 to gain four feats, Extra Attack, and dual wielding.

## Alternative Build Route
- This Swashbuckler Rogue variant trades subtlety for sheer combat prowess, focusing on aggressive, up-close encounters rather than relying solely on stealth and ranged attacks.
- You can still soften up enemies with a surprise sneak attack, but the real strength comes once you’re in the thick of battle, weaving through enemies and striking with precision.
- Multiclass into Fighter, eventually choosing the Eldritch Knight subclass.
- By Level 7, you’ll have access to the Booming Blade cantrip, adding magical punch to your melee strikes.
- Along the way, you pick up Fighter abilities like Action Surge and Extra Attack, plus three additional Feats.
- This combination empowers you to deal consistent damage, react to changing combat situations, and control the battlefield with a unique blend of finesse and force.

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- This build page has been updated for the Patch 8 version of Baldur’s Gate 3.
- Patch 8 introduces the Swashbuckler subclass and the Booming Blade cantrip, enhancing Rogue build versatility.
- Swashbuckler adds increased mobility and flair, allowing Rogues to slip in and out of stealth with agility and style.
- Choosing the Booming Blade path shifts the Rogue’s playstyle from purely stealth-based to a more aggressive, melee-oriented strategy; opening with a powerful stealth attack is still viable, but this build excels in prolonged frontline combat.
- Patch 8 adds 12 new subclasses, spells, and cantrips; the most important for this build is the Swashbuckler Rogue and Booming Blade cantrip, which you can access by selecting a High Elf for more melee burst starting at level 1.
