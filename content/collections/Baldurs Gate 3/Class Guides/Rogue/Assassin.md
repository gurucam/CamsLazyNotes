## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A shadowy **stealth assassin** who strikes from the darkness with lethal precision, eliminating targets before they even know what hit them.
- Plays like “**hide in shadows, surprise and crit-burst priority targets, vanish**”—your opening turn deletes enemies with massive Sneak Attack spikes.
- Versatile ranged sniper with melee backup, excelling in ambushes and utility outside combat.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Stealth initiation → Cunning Action Hide → Sharpshooter Sneak Attack volleys** for devastating surprise crits and sustained pressure.

### Party role
- **Ranged burst DPS:** Massive single-target opener damage via surprise crits and Sneak Attack.
- **Utility specialist:** Expertise skills for locks, traps, stealth, and social encounters.
- **Ambush control:** High initiative, hides to reposition and deny enemy actions.

### Pros
- **Insane opening burst** from surprise crits + Sneak Attack + Sharpshooter
- Excellent non-combat utility with skills and expertise
- Multiple bonus actions for endless hide/mobility

### Cons
- **Squishy** with low HP and light armor
- Reliant on weapons and advantage/stealth setups
- Weaker in prolonged fights without surprise

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Assassin** subclass (surprise crits, initiative advantage)
- Level 4: **Sharpshooter** (huge ranged damage toggle)
- Level 5: **Uncanny Dodge** (halves incoming damage)
- Level 10: **Alert** (initiative dominance for consistent openers)

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character

- **Background:** Criminal
- **Skills:** Sleight of Hand, Insight, Stealth, Persuasion, Acrobatics
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 16 / INT 10 / WIS 14 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Wood Elf)
- **Fleet of Foot** (highest movement speed for kiting/positioning)
- **Stealth proficiency** in natural environments
- **Fey Ancestry** (advantage vs. charm, immune to magical sleep)
- **Darkvision** (quality-of-life)

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **Githyanki** (Astral Knowledge, Misty Step, Martial Prodigy, Enhanced Leap).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** Longbow for ranged bursts (acquire early).
- **Armor vs clothing:** Light Armour for stealth and AC.
- **Back-bar ranged:** Daggers for melee backup or throws.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Complete the prologue, recruit companions, and stabilize your early economy (sell/stock up).

- Push to **Level 5** quickly (Uncanny Dodge).
- Reach the **Underdark / Grymforge** and craft **Adamantine** gear.
