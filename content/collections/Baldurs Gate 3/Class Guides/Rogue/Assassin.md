  - Notes:
    - Cunning Action Hide: Hide from enemies by succeeding Stealth checks. Stick to the dark and avoid enemy sightlines. Attacking or casting a spell will reveal your location.
    - Cunning Action Dash: Cover more distance this turn: double your Movement Speed.

- Disengage: You can move to the flank or back of the opposition while in an engagement without taking an opportunity attack. If you need to flee, use disengage to avoid taking needless damage.

## Alternative Build Route
Our alternative Assassin Rogue build leans into a more aggressive, melee-focused approach. You can still initiate combat with ranged sneak attacks for a burst of opening damage, but the heart of this build lies in close-quarters combat, where you’ll rely on melee strikes to finish the job.

By multiclassing into Fighter, you’ll unlock the Eldritch Knight subclass and gain access to the Booming Blade cantrip by Level 7. This path also grants powerful Fighter abilities like Action Surge, Extra Attack, and three bonus Feats, giving you a potent combination of sustained damage and tactical flexibility.

Level Class Selection
- 1 Rogue: Sneak Attack (Ranged & Melee)
- 2 Rogue: Cunning Action: Hide
- 3 Rogue: Subclass: Assassin
- 4 Rogue: Feat: Dual Wielder
- 5 Fighter: Multiclass: Fighter
- 6 Fighter: Action Surge
- 7 Fighter: Subclass: Eldritch Knight
- 8 Fighter: Feat: +2 Dexterity
- 9 Fighter: Extra Attack
- 10 Fighter: Feat: Alert
- 11 Fighter: Remarkable Athlete: Proficiency and Jump
- 12 Fighter: Feat: Savage Attack

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- The most significant update to Rogue builds in Patch 8 is the introduction of the Swashbuckling subclass and the Booming Blade cantrip.
- Swashbuckler offers greater mobility and agility, making it easier to move in and out of stealth with fluid precision.
- Alternatively, you can take the Arcane Trickster subclass or multiclass into Fighter (Eldritch Knight) to gain access to Booming Blade.
- Opting for the Booming Blade route shifts the Rogue’s traditional stealth-heavy approach toward a more direct, melee-focused playstyle; this build thrives in sustained frontline skirmishes.

### Patch 7
- Combat and gameplay for the Assassin Rogue did not see any changes with the release of Patch 7.
- Larian Studios’ main focus in this patch is mods and some new cinematic scenes focusing on evil endings (modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager).
