## Character Creation
- Race: Wood Elf
- Class: Rogue
- Subclass: Thief (also listed as Assassin in the Character Creation table and the Level Progression table)
- Background: Criminal
- Ability Scores: STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 16 / INT 10 / WIS 14 / CHA 10
- Proficiencies: Sleight of Hand, Insight, Stealth, Persuasion, Acrobatics

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Sneak Attack (Ranged & Melee)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Get into stealth (before a fight or during), gain Advantage, then use Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Attack targets engaged with allies or use Hide to gain Advantage; prioritize ranged Sneak Attack.
  - Notes:
    - Sneak Attack: Deal additional damage to an enemy you have Advantage against; once per turn.
    - To gain Advantage: be hiding, or have the enemy engaged with another within 1.5m.
    - The Rogue doesn’t have Longbow proficiency built in; Wood Elf is optimal for this benefit. Gloves of Archery can grant bow proficiencies.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Cunning Action
  - Cunning Action: Hide (bonus action)
  - Cunning Action: Dash (bonus action)
  - Cunning Action: Disengage (bonus action)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Hide to get in stealth and gain Advantage; use Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Use Dash to create space or close distance; Disengage to retreat safely; end turns with Hide when possible.
  - Notes:
    - Use Hide at the end of the turn to go into stealth.
    - You can exit dialogue and reposition non-talking party members to set up a big stealth opening.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass choice (recommended: Thief)
  - Fast Hands: Gain an additional bonus action.
  - Second-Story Work: Resistance to Falling damage.
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Bonus action Hide to gain Advantage; action Sneak Attack; bonus action return to stealth.
    - Turn 2+: Repeat the loop: stealth → Sneak Attack → return to stealth; use extra bonus action for dash, potion, poison on the weapon, etc.
  - Notes:
    - “Your goal, 100% of each turn is to get into stealth, and range sneak attack at least once.”
    - The double bonus action is used to hide, then dash/potion/poison, or to go back into stealth after attacking.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Feat: Sharpshooter (recommended)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Stealth opener (Hide) → Sneak Attack; keep using bonus actions to control positioning and return to stealth.
    - Turn 2+: Continue ranged Sneak Attack loop; toggle Sharpshooter if needed.
  - Notes:
    - Sharpshooter: Your ranged weapon attacks do not receive penalties from High Ground Rules; ranged weapon attacks with weapons you are proficient with have a -5 penalty to Attack Roll but deal an additional 10 damage.
    - You can toggle Sharpshooter off via passives on the toolbar.
    - Alternative mentioned: Dual Wielder feat for a double Rapier dual-wield build (off-hand attack with a bonus action for multiple attacks).

### Level 5

  - Sneak Attack damage increased to 3d6
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Stealth opener → Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Gameplay remains unchanged; keep applying stealth and Advantage to land Sneak Attack.
  - Notes:
    - “Look for gear, potions, arrows, and poison to amplify damage.”

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Expertise into two skills (good choices listed: Deception and Acrobatics)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Stealth opener → Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Gameplay remains unchanged.
  - Notes:
    - Expertise helps with overland, dialogue, and exploration rather than combat generally.
    - End of Act 1 note: visit traders, stock up on camp/alchemy supplies; check Act 1 items and permanent bonuses; Grymforge has powerful Adamantine items.

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Evasion (Dexterity Saving Throw effects: no damage on success; half damage on fail, when effect would deal half damage on success)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Stealth opener → Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Gameplay remains unchanged.
  - Notes:
    - Evasion helps avoid damage.

  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Dexterity, as described)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Stealth opener → Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Gameplay remains unchanged.

- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Stealth opener → Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Use Invisibility after you use Disengage and run away from attackers; heal up with bonus action.
  - Notes:
    - Supreme Sneak is less useful in combat because it costs an action; strong out of combat for sneaking and avoiding detection.

### Level 10

- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Stealth opener → Sneak Attack; use Lucky in critical situations when you need Advantage or a reroll.

  - Reliable Talent
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Stealth opener → Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Gameplay remains unchanged.
  - Notes:
    - Reliable Talent: When you make an Ability Check with a Skill you are Proficient with, the lowest result you can roll is 10.

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Dexterity, as described)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Stealth opener → Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Continue simple ranged combat loop and outside-of-combat utility.
