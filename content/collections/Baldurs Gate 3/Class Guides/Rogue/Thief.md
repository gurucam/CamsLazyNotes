## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A classic **stealth-first Rogue** built around ranged Sneak Attacks, extreme action economy, and unmatched out-of-combat utility.
- The Thief excels at **scouting, lockpicking, trap disarming, and stealing**, while still delivering huge burst damage when fights start on your terms.
- In combat, the build leans heavily on **bonus actions** to hide, reposition, apply poisons, and reset stealth every turn.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Use stealth and bonus actions to secure Advantage every turn, then deliver consistent Sneak Attacks from range while staying untouchable.**

### Party role
- **Ranged damage dealer:** reliable Sneak Attack damage with bows.
- **Utility specialist:** traps, locks, scouting, and dialogue checks.
- **Setup enabler:** starts fights from stealth and controls tempo.

### Pros
- Incredible action economy (double bonus actions)
- Best non-combat utility in the game
- Very safe ranged damage loop
- Scales well with consumables and ammunition

### Cons
- Weapon- and positioning-dependent
- Less impressive sustained damage without Advantage
- Pure Thief falls off slightly late-game without multiclassing

### Power spikes to look forward to
- **Level 2:** Cunning Action (stealth loop online)
- **Level 3:** Thief subclass (extra bonus action)
- **Level 4:** Sharpshooter (big ranged damage)
- **Level 9:** Supreme Sneak (out-of-combat dominance)
- **Level 10:** Lucky (Advantage control)
- **Level 12:** Dexterity capstone

- **Race:** Wood Elf
- **Class:** Rogue
- **Subclass:** Thief (Level 3)
- **Background:** Criminal
- **Armor:** Light Armour

### Race notes (from the guide)
- **Wood Elf** is recommended for:

## Level-by-level progression (Rogue 1 → 12)

### Level 1 — Rogue 1
**Gain**
- Sneak Attack (Ranged & Melee)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Start encounters from stealth whenever possible and open with a ranged Sneak Attack.
- Prioritize targets already engaged by allies if stealth isn’t available.
- Stay at range; early survivability is low if you get caught.

### Level 2 — Rogue 2
**Gain**
- Cunning Action: Hide
- Cunning Action: Dash
- Cunning Action: Disengage

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Bonus-action Hide becomes your core enabler for Advantage.
- Dash lets you reposition without sacrificing attacks.
- Disengage is your safety valve when enemies get too close.

### Level 3 — Rogue 3 (Thief)
**Gain**
- Subclass: Thief
- Fast Hands (additional Bonus Action)
- Second-Story Work (Resistance to Falling damage)

**Play style (Level 3)**
- This is the defining level: double bonus actions mean **Hide → Attack → Hide** loops.
- One bonus action is usually spent gaining Advantage; the second is for positioning, items, or re-hiding.
- You should feel extremely slippery from this point forward.

### Level 4 — Rogue 4
**Gain**
- Feat: **Sharpshooter** (recommended)

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Toggle Sharpshooter based on hit chance; Advantage makes it far easier to sustain.
- High ground penalties no longer matter, simplifying ranged positioning.
- Your burst damage increases significantly when attacks land.

### Level 5 — Rogue 5
**Gain**
- Uncanny Dodge
- Sneak Attack increases to 3d6

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Damage loop stays the same, but survivability improves dramatically.
- Use Uncanny Dodge reactively to stay aggressive instead of retreating.
- Consumables start to matter more from here on.

### Level 6 — Rogue 6
**Gain**
- Expertise (recommended: Deception, Acrobatics)

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Combat loop unchanged.
- You now dominate dialogue, traps, and exploration checks.
- Prepare to wrap up Act 1 with final gear and bonuses.

### Level 7 — Rogue 7
**Gain**
- Evasion

**Play style (Level 7)**
- You’re much harder to punish with spells and AoE.
- Continue playing safe and opportunistic; avoid unnecessary exposure.

### Level 8 — Rogue 8
**Gain**
- Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Dexterity)

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Higher Dexterity improves accuracy, damage, AC, and initiative.
- Advantage + Sharpshooter becomes more consistent.
- You should feel very reliable at deleting priority targets.

### Level 9 — Rogue 9
**Gain**
- Supreme Sneak (Invisibility once per Short Rest)

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Supreme Sneak is mostly an out-of-combat tool.
- Use it to reposition, escape bad pulls, or bypass encounters entirely.
- In combat, your normal hide-based loop is usually stronger.

### Level 10 — Rogue 10
**Gain**
- Feat: **Lucky**

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Lucky gives you control over critical rolls.
- Spend points when a Sneak Attack *must* land or a save *must* succeed.
- This reinforces consistency rather than raw damage.

### Level 11 — Rogue 11
**Gain**
- Reliable Talent

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Non-combat mastery: skill checks become nearly automatic.
- Combat flow stays unchanged.

### Level 12 — Rogue 12
**Gain**
- Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Dexterity)

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Dexterity caps at 20 (or higher with permanent bonuses).
- You finish as a hyper-consistent ranged damage dealer with unmatched utility.
