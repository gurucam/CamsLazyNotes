## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **hybrid caster Rogue**: you still play the classic stealth + Sneak Attack game, but you add **crowd control, stuns, and immobilization** from Arcane Trickster spells.
- The build leans ranged because it’s easier to start fights from stealth, maintain advantage, and land consistent Sneak Attacks, while your spells cover the “I need control right now” moments.
- Patch 8 opens up more melee options via **Booming Blade**, but the default route remains a stealth-first sniper who can also lock targets down.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **End turns hidden, start fights from stealth, and spend your action on Sneak Attack while using spells only when control wins the fight.**

### Party role
- **Stealth damage dealer:** ranged or finesse attacks with Sneak Attack as the core damage engine.
- **Control support:** stuns/immobilize/utility spells to swing dangerous turns.
- **Skill utility:** traps/locks/pickpocketing + strong dialogue and exploration coverage.

### Pros
- Excellent single-target damage from stealth
- Strong crowd control toolkit for a Rogue
- Very strong “go first” play once Initiative is stacked

### Cons
- Not a frontline class; positioning matters
- Advantage/Sneak Attack conditions can be punishing if you ignore setup
- Limited spell slots (you can’t solve every problem with magic)

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Cunning Action** (bonus action Hide/Dash/Disengage)
- Level 3: **Arcane Trickster** + control spell package
- Level 4: **Sharpshooter**
- Level 5: **Uncanny Dodge** + Sneak Attack scaling
- Level 9: **Magical Ambush**
- Level 10: **Alert** + **Hold Person**
- Level 12: **Dexterity 20**

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Wood Elf
- **Class:** Rogue
- **Subclass:** Arcane Trickster
- **Background:** Criminal
- **Skills:** Sleight of Hand, Insight, Stealth, Persuasion, Acrobatics
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 14 / INT 16 / WIS 10 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Wood Elf)
- Wood Elf is recommended because you gain **Longbow proficiency**, **highest movement**, **stealth proficiency**, **Fey Ancestry**, and **Darkvision**.
- If you do not have longbow proficiency early, **Gloves of Archery** can also cover it.

### Starting setup
- Equip a **shortsword for melee**, a **dagger in the offhand**, and a **bow** for ranged combat.
- Your core damage comes from **Sneak Attack**, so plan your turns around gaining **Advantage** (stealth/hide, ally within 1.5m of the target, prone targets, etc.).
- If you can’t reliably get Advantage, play closer to your melee allies so you can Sneak Attack off their engagement.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Complete Prologue
- Recruit Companions
- Unlock Withers, respec companions to proper class/ability score
- Collect the Necromancy of Thay (important in Act 3)
- Reached Hollowed City/Druid Grove
- Sell, Stock up, complete quests
- Unlock summons, Scratch, Shovel
- Progress to level 5
- Reach Underdark and Grymforge
- Check all Permanent Bonuses in Act 1 and the best Gear

## Level-by-level progression (Rogue 1 → 12)
> Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop.

### Level 1 — Rogue 1
**Gain**
- Sneak Attack (Ranged & Melee)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Try to start fights from stealth (Shift + C) and open with a ranged Sneak Attack when possible.
- If you can’t get stealth, attack enemies that are already engaged with a melee ally (within 1.5m) to trigger Sneak Attack conditions.
- Keep range as your comfort zone early—your defenses are thin, and positioning is everything.

### Level 2 — Rogue 2
**Gain**
- Cunning Action (Hide, Dash, Disengage)

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Bonus action **Hide** becomes your bread-and-butter: hide → gain Advantage → Sneak Attack.
- Use **Dash** to create space or to reach a clean firing angle; use **Disengage** when melee pressure is about to punish you.
- When a fight begins via dialogue, move non-talking party members into position, then start from stealth and open big.

### Level 3 — Rogue 3 (Arcane Trickster)
**Gain**
- Subclass: Arcane Trickster
- Cantrips: Acid Splash, True Strike (+ Mage Hand is granted)
- Spells: Tasha’s Hideous Laughter, Sleep, Find Familiar (and Mage Hand utility)

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Your spells are designed to **crowd control and do a small amount of damage**—use them to stop a key enemy from acting, not as your main DPS.
- Default loop stays stealth-first: use your action for Sneak Attack, and spend spells when a stun/immobilize makes the next turn safe.
- Use Mage Hand and Find Familiar for exploration, distractions, and utility while moving through areas.

### Level 4 — Rogue 4
**Gain**
- Feat: Sharpshooter
- Spell selection: Charm Person (recommended)

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Keep Sharpshooter toggled smartly: it hits harder but lowers accuracy, so turn it off if you’re missing too much early.
- The “easy mode” loop remains: hide behind cover, bonus action hide, and snipe with Sneak Attack at range.
- If you’re experimenting with melee dual-wielding, remember your bonus action is often better spent hiding to secure Sneak Attack.

### Level 5 — Rogue 5
**Gain**
- Uncanny Dodge
- Sneak Attack damage increased to 3d6
- Replace Spell (optional): Sleep becomes weaker after level 5

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Your damage and survivability both jump here—Sneak Attack scales and Uncanny Dodge reduces incoming spikes.
- Keep gearing and stocking arrows/poison to amplify damage, but your turn plan stays the same.
- Replace spells you’ve outgrown (Sleep is the obvious one once enemy HP pools rise).

### Level 6 — Rogue 6
**Gain**
- Expertise: Deception and Persuasion (recommended)
- Replace Spell (optional)

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Combat loop doesn’t change much; you’re just more consistent in dialogue and exploration.
- Around here, you’ll be closing out Act 1—check merchants, stock camp/alchemy supplies, and consider crafting Adamantine items before moving on.

### Level 7 — Rogue 7
**Gain**
- Evasion
- Spell Slots: +1 level 1 spell slot, gain level 2 spell slot
- Spell: Invisibility (touch a creature to turn it Invisible for 10 turns, concentration)

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Your defenses sharpen: Evasion helps you avoid big AoE punishment, so you can play more aggressively with positioning.
- Invisibility gives you cleaner openings and safer resets—use it to set up stealth starts or disengage from bad angles.
- Keep your action economy sacred: Sneak Attack is still the action you want most turns.

### Level 8 — Rogue 8
**Gain**
- Feat: +2 Dexterity (to 18)
- Spell: Misty Step (recommended)

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Misty Step is your “fix my positioning” button—use it to reach clean sightlines or escape pressure without giving up your action.
- With higher Dexterity, your ranged Sneak Attacks feel much more reliable; keep leaning on stealth starts.
- If enemies are forcing melee, Misty Step lets you re-establish range and end the turn hidden again.

### Level 9 — Rogue 9
**Gain**
- Subclass passive: Magical Ambush (while hidden, targets have Disadvantage on saving throws against your spells)

**Play style (Level 9)**
- This is the incentive to cast control spells from stealth: if you’re going to spend your action on a stun, do it while hidden.
- Use Magical Ambush specifically for spells where the chance to land is low—don’t waste turns missing key CC.
- You still want to attack most turns; weave spells in when they win the fight, not “because you can.”

### Level 10 — Rogue 10
**Gain**
- Cantrip: Firebolt (or Blade Ward / Minor Illusion alternatives mentioned)
- Spell: Hold Person
- Feat: Alert (+5 Initiative, can’t be Surprised)

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Alert changes fights: you’re very likely to go first, so pick the enemy that would do the most damage and remove them immediately.
- Hold Person is strongest when cast from stealth (Magical Ambush) and then punished from melee range (attacks within 3m are always critical hits).
- Your “best turn” is often: open from stealth, lock or delete the biggest threat, then end hidden again.

### Level 11 — Rogue 11
**Gain**
- Reliable Talent
- Spell: Mirror Image (3 duplicates; each duplicate increases AC by 3, insane survivability)

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Mirror Image is your “I must live” button—use it when you expect incoming damage or need to survive to the next turn.
- Reliable Talent keeps your out-of-combat identity extremely strong; keep leaning into locks, traps, and dialogue checks.
- In combat, stay disciplined: position, Sneak Attack, and only burn spells when they swing the tempo.

### Level 12 — Rogue 12
**Gain**
- Feat: +2 Dexterity (to 20)

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Keep things simple: with Dexterity 20, Sharpshooter, and Alert, you have plenty of damage and consistency.
- Your endgame identity is “go first, control or delete a priority target, then disappear.”

# Best consumables / items (single-use)

- **Potion of Speed**
  - Gain extra action, +2 AC, Advantage on Dexterity Saving Throws, and double movement speed.
  - Best when you can open from stealth and immediately convert the extra action into tempo (delete a priority target or set up control, then still Sneak Attack).

- **Elixir of Bloodlust**
  - Once per turn when you kill a foe, you gain HP 5 temporary hit points and an additional action.
  - This is a snowball consumable—use it when you expect to get a kill early and chain actions into more kills.

- **Drow Poison**
  - Weapon poison that adds Constitution Saving Throw or becomes Poisoned and falls Asleep.
  - Use it to shut down a dangerous enemy when you can’t afford them to act (especially good before your control spells become reliable).

- **Potion of Flying**
  - Drink to gain a flying speed of 60ft for one hour.
  - Solves positioning: take high ground, ignore terrain, and keep your stealth angles clean.

- **Elixir of Heroism**
  - Gain 10 temp HP and become Blessed until a long rest.
  - Great when you want steadier accuracy (especially if Sharpshooter is staying on) and extra safety in longer fights.

- **Potion of Greater Healing**
  - 4d4 + 4 hit points restored.
  - Use it to stay alive without spending actions on anything that would break your stealth tempo.

- **Oil of Accuracy**
  - Coat Weapon. Bonus of +2 in Attack Rolls.
  - Helps stabilize hit chance when Sharpshooter penalties start to sting, or when you’re shooting high-AC targets.

- **Elixir of Vigilance**
  - Drink to gain a +5 bonus to Initiative and you can’t be Surprised.
  - Stacks with the “go first” plan (especially once Alert arrives) so you can decide the fight before enemies get a turn.

### Ammunition (single-use arrows)
- **Arrow of Ice**
  - Deals weapon damage + 2d4 Cold and creates ice surface for 2 turns in a 2m radius.
  - Great for controlling space and punishing clustered enemies or narrow corridors.

- **Arrow of Roaring Thunder**
  - deals weapon damage, knocks back 5 meters if failed strength throw.
  - Use for environmental kills, breaking enemy formations, or pushing threats off your backline.

- **Arrow of Many Targets**
  - Deals weapon damage and an additional half of that damage to three other targets in range.
  - Strong when you need to spread damage while still keeping your main target pressure.

- **Arrow of Dragon/Aberration/Humanoid**
  - Deals weapon damage, and double damage against Dragon, Aberration, or Humanoid.
  - Best “delete” tool for the right enemy type—use it when a single target must die.

- **Arrow of Salving**
  - Cures a target of poisoned, paralyzed, and blinded conditions.
  - Keep a few as emergency cleanses when status effects would otherwise end a fight.

- **Arrow of Transposition**
  - teleports the shooter wherever this arrow is fired.
  - A positioning reset that doesn’t require spell slots—perfect for regaining stealth angles or escaping pressure.

---

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
- **Luck of the Far Realms**
  - When you make a successful Attack Roll against a foe, you can change that hit into a Critical Hit.
  - Use it to guarantee a huge Sneak Attack moment when a target absolutely must drop.

- **Cull of the Weak**
  - When you bring a creature down to fewer hit points than your number of evolved Illithid powers, it dies and all nearby creatures take 1-4 Psychic damage.
  - Helps clean up fights and can turn a near-kill into an instant execute that also chips nearby enemies.

- **Psionic Backlash**
  - When an enemy within 9m casts a spell, you can use your reaction to inflict ld4 Psychic damage to the caster per the spell’s level.
  - Passive pressure against casters without spending your action, keeping your Sneak Attack rhythm intact.

- **Blackhole**
  - Area-based suck-in that slows targets.
  - Great for grouping enemies for party AoE, or pulling targets into kill zones while you keep shooting from safety.

- **Repulsor**
  - Massive area knockback that can hit friendlies.
  - Emergency control tool when you’re getting swarmed or need to peel threats off your team.

- **Charm**
  - This is the priority power you want to obtain because you can force enemies to attack something else.
  - Use it to redirect pressure away from your squishier allies (or away from you when stealth breaks).

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
For the alternative Arcane Trickster Rogue build, the guide focuses on a more aggressive, melee-oriented playstyle. While you can still open fights with ranged sneak attacks for a strong burst of damage, the core of this build puts you up close and personal, relying heavily on melee combat once the fight begins. By multiclassing into Fighter, you gain access to Battle Master manoeuvres, Action Surge, Extra Attack, and additional feats.
