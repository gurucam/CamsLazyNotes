- Play Style:

    - Turn 2+: Attack targets engaged with others or use Hide to get in stealth to gain advantage and keep using Sneak Attack.
  - Notes:
    - Focus on Dexterity and Intelligence; the Arcane Trickster subclass at level 3 will use Intelligence for spellcasting modifier.
    - Find a ranged weapon and use light armor.
    - The Rogue doesn’t have Longbow proficiency built in; it’s optimal to pick a Wood Elf (or any Elf) for this benefit, and Gloves of Archery gives Longbow proficiency as well.
    - Early levels: equip a shortsword for melee, with a dagger in the offhand, and a bow for ranged combat.
    - Priority: find Gloves of Archery at the start of the game; look to acquire Elixir of Bloodlust and Oil of Accuracy (you can combine these two).
    - Priority steps listed: Complete Prologue; Recruit Companions; Unlock Withers, respec companions to proper class/ability score; Collect the Necromancy of Thay (important in Act 3); Reached Hollowed City/Druid Grove; Sell, Stock up, complete quests; Unlock summons, Scratch, Shovel; Progress to level 5; Reach Underdark and Grymforge; Check all Permanent Bonuses in Act 1 and the best Gear; Act 1 Checklist for step-by-step completion.

- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use bonus action Hide to get in stealth, gain advantage, and use Sneak Attack.
    - Turn 2+: Use Dash to create space or close the distance; Disengage to flee or reposition without Opportunity Attacks; use Hide at end of turn to go into stealth.
  - Notes:
    - Start encounters from stealth when possible; even during dialogue you can move non-talking party members to an ideal area, buff up, get in stealth, and open for a big stealth attack.

### Level 3

- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use stealth and advantage to open with Sneak Attack for burst damage.
    - Turn 2+: Use spells primarily for crowd control and rely on damage from stealth attacking.

- High Ground: use elevation when melee isn’t impossible to improve damage with a ranged weapon.
- Consumables: consume a potion of speed or shoot a fire arrow at range for increased combat effectiveness.
- Prepare: always get in sneak with Shift + C before combat.
- Sneak Attack: use your action primarily for a sneak attack and double off-hand for three attacks in one turn.
- Movement: use cunning dash to close the distance while still allowing an action
- Disengage: you can move to the flank or back of the opposition while in an engagement without taking an opportunity attack. If you need to flee, use disengage to avoid taking needless damage.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative Arcane Trickster Rogue build focuses on a more aggressive, melee-oriented playstyle; you can still open fights with ranged sneak attacks for a strong burst of damage, but the core puts you into melee once the fight begins.

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- The most significant update in Patch 8 is the availability of the Booming Blade cantrip at Level 1.
- This allows you to deal extra thunder damage each action, adding to an overall damage increase.
- These additions give the assassin playstyle additional options: combine spellcasting utility of Booming Blade with a more aggressive melee fighting style.
- Going with the Booming Blade route changes some of the traditional rogue playstyle; once enemies are engaged, you’ll need to take more of a frontline melee role.

### Patch 7
- Overall, combat and gameplay for the Arcane Trickster Rogue did not see any changes with the release of Patch 7.
- Larian Studios’ main focus in this patch is mods and some new cinematic scenes focusing on evil endings.
- The game now features a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager, allowing players to create and install mods directly within the game.
