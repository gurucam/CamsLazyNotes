  - Notes:
    - The guide calls Level 5 “a big jump in power.”
    - Call Lightning is described as a “perfect use” of a level 3 slot because of passive reactions to increase Lightning damage; “you can call it down again without using a spell slot.”

    - Spirit Guardians is described as “god-tier melee damage,” requires concentration, damages nearby enemies, and halves movement speed.

### Level 11

  - Fighter level 2: Action Surge (Fighter class action)
- Play Style:

## Alternative Build Route
Alternative Tempest Domain Cleric Build (Light Domain) description and level route (as given):
- “If you’re looking for a tank-style Cleric that emphasizes durability and battlefield control over raw offensive power, the Light Domain offers a compelling alternative to the Tempest Domain.”
- “At the heart of this approach is Luminous Armour, which you can access early in Act 1. This unique armor radiates an aura that imposes Disadvantage on enemy attack rolls, allowing your Cleric to stand at the front lines, weakening enemies simply by being near them.”
- “When paired with Spirit Guardians, this build becomes a formidable force in crowd control… This defensive, area-denial playstyle shines in Tactician and Honour Modes…”

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- Patch 8 introduces Booming Blade, described as a cantrip that “significantly boosts the viability of melee-focused builds,” dealing damage on hit and “additional force damage if the target moves afterward.”
- The guide notes Cleric foundations remain intact, but “heightened difficulty of Tactician and Honour Modes” increases demands on durability and resource efficiency.
- The guide notes “the Light Domain offers a compelling alternative” for survivability with offensive capability and says an alternative build is included.

### Patch 7
- “Overall, combat and gameplay for the Tempest Domain Cleric did not see any changes with the release of Patch 7 for Baldur’s Gate 3.”
- Patch 7 focus is described as “mods and some new cinematic scenes focusing on evil endings,” including a modding toolkit and in-game mod manager.
- “This best Tempest Domain Cleric Build Guide remains unchanged for Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 7.”
