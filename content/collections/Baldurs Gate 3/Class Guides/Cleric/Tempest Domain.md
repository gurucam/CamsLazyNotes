## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A storm‑calling frontline cleric who thrives in the middle of combat, drawing attacks and retaliating with thunderous divine power.

- Rewards aggressive positioning, reaction usage, and area damage while retaining strong healing and support tools.

### Core playstyle in one sentence

### Pros
- Excellent area damage and retaliation.
- Strong durability in heavy armour.
- Scales well into mid and late game.

### Cons

### Power spikes
