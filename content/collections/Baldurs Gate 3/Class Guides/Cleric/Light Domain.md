## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- An **offensive Light Domain Cleric** built to function as a **radiant AoE damage dealer** with strong utility, rather than a dedicated healer.
- The build’s identity is **mid-to-late game mob control and area damage**, with the flexibility to heal or support on demand.
- Cleric strengths here come from **survivability (armor + shield)** plus **spell damage and crowd control**, while managing concentration carefully.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Open with a bonus-action summon or heal, drop large-area radiant/fire pressure on clustered enemies, and use reaction-based defense and crowd control to keep your party stable.**

### Party role
- **Radiant AoE damage dealer:** focuses on area damage and burst once key spell slots and domain tools come online.
- **Utility and crowd control:** uses disabling and banish-style control to reduce incoming damage.
- **Backup healer:** can spend bonus actions and prepared heals to stabilize the team without fully committing to a healer identity.

### Pros
- High survivability with **medium armor + shield** baseline
- Excellent **area damage** and strong mid/late-game combat impact
- Strong **range** and party utility (control + support on demand)

### Cons
- **Low mobility** and limited bonus-action options outside a few spells/consumables
- **Concentration-heavy** kit; must choose between competing concentration effects
- Can feel weaker before key AoE options unlock (early levels)

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Radiance of the Dawn** (Channel Divinity AoE damage + darkness dispel)
- Level 5: big jump in **area-based damage** + improved undead turning synergy
- Level 7: access to **level 4 spell slot** and powerful new domain tools
- Level 11–12: endgame **summon + feast-style utility** with top-tier spell access

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Asmodeus Tiefling
- **Class:** Cleric
- **Subclass:** Light Domain
- **Background:** Folk Hero
- **Skills:** Religion, Insight
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 10 / WIS 16 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Asmodeus Tiefling)
- Fire Resistance, Darkvision, and built-in retaliation spell access are the main reasons this race is recommended for the build.

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* High Elf (extra cantrip, Fey Ancestry, Darkvision).

## Level-by-level progression (Cleric 1 → 12)

### Level 1 — Cleric 1
**Gain**
- **Subclass: Light Domain** (unlocks domain spells and features)
- **Warding Flare** (reaction-based defense)
- **Always-prepared domain spells** appear even if not selected
- Recommended cantrips: **Sacred Flame**, **Guidance**, **Thaumaturgy**
- Recommended prepared spells at start: **Guiding Bolt**, **Inflict Wounds**, **Cure Wounds**, **Shield of Faith**

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Equip **medium armour + quarterstaff + shield** as early as possible; you want defense online immediately.
- This level’s gameplay is simple: spend spell slots for burst when needed, otherwise lean on cantrips and positioning to conserve resources.
- Early priorities called out by the guide include: prologue → recruit companions → reach Druid Grove → stock up/questing → unlock Withers and respec if needed → push to level 5 → Underdark/Grymforge.

### Level 2 — Cleric 2
**Gain**
- **Turn Undead**
- **Radiance of the Dawn** (Channel Divinity AoE + dispel magical darkness)
- Prepare: **Command** (crowd control options)

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Gameplay largely stays the same, but you now have a strong AoE option through Channel Divinity for damage spikes.
- Turn Undead is situational but can swing undead-heavy fights.

### Level 3 — Cleric 3
**Gain**
- Domain spells unlocked at this tier include **Flaming Sphere** and **Scorching Ray**
- Prepare: **Spiritual Weapon** (bonus action, no concentration; spear form recommended)

**Play style (Level 3)**
- The guide emphasizes opening fights by getting your bonus-action pressure online (summoned weapon) and then choosing either a group-support concentration or direct damage with your action, based on the situation.

### Level 4 — Cleric 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Wisdom** (recommended)

**Gain**
- Prepare cantrip: **Blade Ward**
- Prepare: **Lesser Restoration**

**Play style (Level 4)**
- The guide notes gameplay doesn’t change much here: you mainly get more damage/healing reliability through improved stats and extra preparations.

### Level 5 — Cleric 5
**Gain**
- Domain spells include **Daylight** and a major AoE option (subclass free spells)
- **Destroy Undead** improves your undead-turning value
- Prepare: **Mass Healing Word** (bonus action, wide area healing)
- Prepare: **Glyph of Warding** (AoE with selectable effects)

**Play style (Level 5)**
- This is the guide’s “massive boost in power” point: you gain access to multiple powerful area-based spells and can adapt to enemy resistances by selecting different damage types.
- The guide also calls out prioritizing **Luminous Armour** in Act 1 for a synergy with radiant damage and enemy debuffing.

### Level 6 — Cleric 6
**Gain**
- **Improved Warding Flare** (better reaction-based defense for allies)
- Prepare: **Speak with Dead** (utility)

**Play style (Level 6)**
- The guide’s approach: open with your bonus-action summon, then choose between area damage on stacked enemies or single-target burst on priority threats, and only pivot into healing when necessary.
- Around this time, the guide notes you’re likely transitioning out of Act 1: check traders, stock camp/alchemy supplies, and consider Grymforge crafting before moving to Act 2.

### Level 7 — Cleric 7
**Gain**
- Access to **level 4 spell slot** and new domain tools, including **Wall of Fire** and **Guardian of Faith**
- Prepare: **Banishment**

**Play style (Level 7)**
- The guide calls out the “first turn” priority: establish bonus-action pressure and then drop a big action-based AoE when enemies are stacked; after that, shift into healing or damage based on party status.
- Use CC when you need to reduce incoming damage rather than race damage.

### Level 8 — Cleric 8
**Gain**
- **Potent Spellcasting** (adds Wisdom modifier to cantrip damage)

**Feat**
- **Spell Sniper** (recommended by the guide)

**Also gain (via feat)**
- **Eldritch Blast** cantrip (chosen from Spell Sniper)

**Prepare**
- **Animate Dead**

**Play style (Level 8)**
- The guide describes this as a relatively stable level: you mainly scale your baseline output through improved cantrip damage and an additional tool via the feat.
- Summoned options are intended to be created before combat to add extra bodies and distraction.

### Level 9 — Cleric 9
**Gain**
- New domain unlocks at this tier include **Flame Strike** and **Destructive Wave**
- Prepare: **Mass Cure Wounds**

**Play style (Level 9)**
- The guide frames this as a large power increase: better area damage and better mass healing, with more prepared spells available overall.
- Multiclassing is discussed, but the guide’s default recommendation is to remain pure Cleric to keep top-tier spell progression.

### Level 10 — Cleric 10
**Gain**
- **Divine Intervention** (one-time use)
- Prepare cantrip: **Resistance**
- Prepare: **Greater Restoration**

**Play style (Level 10)**
- The guide recommends treating Divine Intervention like an emergency button (save it for something you can’t complete otherwise).

### Level 11 — Cleric 11
**Gain**
- One **level 6 spell slot**
- Select: **Planar Ally**

**Play style (Level 11)**
- The guide notes Planar Ally (and other long-rest duration tools) can provide a roaming “team” of summons until a long rest, adding free damage and distraction.
- It also notes a late-game workaround to stretch level 6 casting using certain quarterstaves in Act 3 (Staff of Spellpower or Markoheshkir).

### Level 12 — Cleric 12
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Wisdom (to 20)**

**Prepare**
- **Heroes’ Feast**

**Play style (Level 12)**
- The guide emphasizes you should feel very powerful here due to multiple summons plus strong damage/support flexibility, with Wisdom scaling continuing to matter.
