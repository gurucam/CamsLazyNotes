## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Heal Allies: Below level 5, focus on healing allies and transition to damage after level 5.
2. Bonus Action: Try to consume your bonus action each turn with healing, Spiritual Weapon, or potions.
3. Blessed: Cast Bless outside of combat before engaging and get a lot of turns without having to use a turn in combat.
4. Crowd Control: CC opponents with Command and Banishment to take less damage overall.
5. Cantrips: Use these when lacking spell slots are you’re not committed to a major offensive spell to keep some spell slots in reserve.
6. Guiding Bolt: Early on this is your big nuke spell and it’s wise to use it on the first turn when teammates don’t need a heal.
7. Area vs Single Target: When using Fireball or Glyph of Warding, make sure to not include friends as they will take damage.
8. Consumables: Take advantage of a Potion of Speed when you need multiple actions per turn.
9. Health Potions: Make sure teammates are stocked up on healing potions so you can focus on damage, not healing.
10. Range: Keep your distance as you are a range damage dealer with the light cleric.
