## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- The Knowledge Domain is focused on roleplaying, dialogue, and crowd control for the Cleric class.
- Heavy in crowd control and “stuns,” with domain spells meant to aid your play style and expected to be heavy crowd control.
- Gains extra skill proficiency and expertise so one character can be very strong in dialogue, exploration, and influencing quests.

### Core Playstyle
- A support build that keeps the party alive with healing and buffs, debuffs and controls enemies, and uses cantrips when spell slots are low while staying durable in medium armour and a shield.

### Party Role
- Healing and support for the party (including area-based healing on harder fights).
- Crowd control and debuffing enemies (domain spell kit and control tools).
- Dialogue, exploration, and quest influence via extra skill proficiency/expertise and broad skill access.

### Pros
- Strong and versatile subclass if used correctly.
- Strong in utility, exploration and dialogue based gameplay.
- Excels at healing, supporting, and debuffing enemies with crowd control domain spells.

### Cons
- Not the best pick if you are looking for a high-damage caster.
- You don’t get heavy armour proficiency with this build (Helldusk Armour is noted as an exception later).
- Many buffs, debuffs, and spells require concentration, and limited spell slots early can make spellcasting tough at the start.

### Power Spikes
- Level 5: “a massive spike in power due to subclass spells and level 3 spells.”
- Level 9: “a big boost in power… when you learn more powerful spells.”

    - Banishment: “one of the best single-target stuns… removes a target for two turns… Cast this only with a higher percentage around 65% or so otherwise, it’s too risky.”

  - Notes:
    - “Select the Hereoes’ Feast spell and try to obtain either Staff of Spellpower or Markoheshki to cast two level 6 spells that last until a long rest.”
    - Heroes’ Feast: “can’t be poisoned, diseased, or frightened… HP increases… Wisdom Saves with Advantage… Lasts until Long Rest.”
    - Death Ward: prevents dropping to 0 hit points once; “remains conscious with 1 hit point left… Lasts until a Long Rest.”

- 10 gameplay tips and tricks for playing a Knowledge Domain Cleric:
  1. Heal Allies: focus on healing allies vs doing damage so your heavy hitters can spend actions and bonus action doing damage.
  2. Bonus Action Heal: Make the most of your bonus action heal in conjunction with primary action-based heal.
  3. Bless: Cast Bless outside of combat before engaging and get a lot of turns without having to use a turn in combat.
  4. Crowd Control: CC opponents with Blind, and Command to take less damage overall.
  5. Cantrips: Use these when lacking spell slots are you’re not committed to a major offensive spell to keep some spell slots in reserve.
  6. Guiding Bolt: Early on this is your big nuke spell and it’s wise to use it on the first turn when teammates don’t need a heal.
  7. Area vs Single Target: Make sure to get the most out of each spell and if you need multiple players healed, get in position, and use an area based heal.
  8. Consumables: Take advantage of a Potion of Speed when you need multiple actions per turn.
  9. Health Potions: Make sure teammates are stocked up on healing potions in case they are out of your line of sight or need massive healing themselves.
  10. Range: Make sure to hang out at medium range where you can melee heal or do damage but not too far back to line of sight of your teammates.
- Early gameplay notes:
  - Equip a One-Handed weapon and Shield as soon as possible; quarterstaffs can be combined with shields for extra free spells and Armour Class (AC).
  - Rely on cantrips for damage when out of spell slots like Sacred Flame.
  - “Look to combine Elixir of Peerless Focus with Potion of Speed… These two stack together for a powerful effect early in BG3.”

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative Knowledge Domain Cleric Build:
  - “A strong alternative to the Knowledge Domain Cleric build is a tank-focused setup that weakens enemies using Radiating Orb from the Luminous Armour set.”
  - “This gear can be acquired in Act 1 and remains useful throughout the game, allowing you to deal consistent damage with Spirit Guardians while controlling the battlefield.”
  - “However, the build relies on the Light Domain subclass.”

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- “The most notable change for Clerics in Patch 8 of Baldur’s Gate 3 is the introduction of the Booming Blade cantrip.”
- “Despite this addition, the core Cleric roles, healer, tank, and radiant damage dealer, remain largely intact.”
- “There are also recent buffs to enemy difficulty, especially in Tactician and Honour Mode. Therefore, you might want to consider our alternative build designed for greater survivability and combat strength.”
