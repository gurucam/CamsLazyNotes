## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **support-first Cleric** built for **dialogue, exploration, and control**: you bring reliable healing, buffs, and crowd control while your party’s damage dealers do the killing.
- The Knowledge Domain’s identity is **utility + “brain” skills**—you pick up extra proficiency/expertise and lean into investigation, religion, arcana, and social checks when needed.
- In combat, you play like a **mid-range anchor**: keep allies alive, keep enemies locked down, and position so you can reach the whole team quickly.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Buff and stabilize your party, lock down priority enemies with control, and use efficient heals (including bonus-action heals) so your damage dealers can spend their turns attacking.**

### Party role
- **Primary support / healer:** keep allies topped off and recover from spikes of damage.
- **Crowd control & “stuns”:** stop dangerous targets from acting so your party takes less damage overall.
- **Utility / face-helper:** extra skills and proficiency tools to handle exploration and dialogue-heavy moments.

### Pros
- Excellent **healing + support uptime** (bonus-action healing pairs well with action-based healing).
- Strong **utility** for exploration and dialogue (extra skill proficiency + expertise).
- Domain spell package leans into **control**, giving you answers to many encounters.

### Cons
- Not a top-tier **damage dealer** (you’re strongest when enabling others).
- Many key effects rely on **concentration**, so getting hit can disrupt your plan.
- A lot of value comes from **positioning** and choosing the right tools for the encounter.

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Knowledge of the Ages** (big utility spike for skill-heavy play).
- Level 5: access to **level 3 spell slots** + major control/mobility upgrades.
- Level 8: **War Caster** (stabilizes your concentration-heavy gameplay).
- Level 12: endgame support package upgrades (high-tier party buffs and safety tools).

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Githyanki
- **Class:** Cleric
- **Subclass:** Knowledge Domain
- **Background:** Folk Hero
- **Skills:** Medicine, Persuasion
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 10 / WIS 16 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Githyanki)
- **Astral Knowledge** lets you boost skill proficiency in an ability of your choice once per Long Rest (great for dialogue/exploration flexibility).
- You also gain extra racial utility (including mobility/psionics) that complements a mid-range support style.

### Knowledge Domain notes (key subclass identity)
- Heavy emphasis on **crowd control** domain spells at various levels.
- **Skill Expertise** at level 1: you can choose two skills for expertise from **History, Nature, Religion, Arcana**.

### Starting setup
- **Armor:** medium armour
- **Weapons:** one hand + shield (mace/quarterstaff + shield)
- **General rule:** stay in medium armour through the game; the guide notes one late exception where a specific Act 3 armour piece grants heavy armour proficiency.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- **Heal Allies:** focus on healing allies vs doing damage so your heavy hitters can spend actions and bonus action doing damage.
- **Bonus Action Heal:** make the most of your bonus action heal in conjunction with primary action-based heal.
- **Bless:** cast your party buff outside of combat before engaging to get many turns of value.
- **Crowd Control:** control opponents to take less damage overall.
- **Consumables:** take advantage of a Potion of Speed when you need multiple actions per turn.
- **Health Potions:** keep teammates stocked in case they’re out of line of sight or need massive healing themselves.
- **Range:** hang out at medium range so you can reach allies without being isolated.

## Level-by-level progression (Cleric 1 → 12)
> This build is “support-loop” driven. Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default way to take turns: stabilize allies first, then control enemies, then contribute damage when safe.

### Level 1 — Cleric 1 (Knowledge Domain)
**Subclass**
- **Knowledge Domain**

**Gain**
- **Cantrips:** Sacred Flame, Guidance, Thaumaturgy
- **Prepared spells (level 1 loadout):** Guiding Bolt, Bless, Cure Wounds, Healing Word
- **Domain spells (always prepared):** Command, Sleep
- **Subclass feature:** Skill Expertise (choose two expertise skills from History, Nature, Religion, Arcana)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Your best early healing combo is **bonus-action healing + action healing** in the same turn when someone is in danger.
- Use your early offensive option when no one needs immediate healing, and fall back to cantrips to conserve resources.
- Lean into the subclass identity: you have **always-prepared control tools**, so flex your prepared spells around what the fight demands.

### Level 2 — Cleric 2
**Gain**
- **Turn Undead**
- **Prepared spell:** Shield of Faith

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Choose between maintaining your party buff or protecting a focused ally with your defense buff—both compete for concentration.
- Consider pre-casting your defensive buff before combat when you expect a teammate to be focused.

### Level 3 — Cleric 3
**Gain**
- **Level 2 spells unlocked**
- **Domain spells (always prepared):** Calm Emotions, Hold Person
- **Racial utility (if Githyanki):** Jump (race action)
- **Prepared spell:** Spiritual Weapon

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Your floating weapon is a huge early power spike because it’s a **bonus action** and doesn’t require concentration.
- A common opener is: cast your party buff, then summon the floating weapon to immediately add pressure.

### Level 4 — Cleric 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Wisdom**

**Gain**
- **Cantrip:** Light
- **Prepared spell:** Lesser Restoration
- **Suggested additional prep after Wisdom increase:** Silence

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Your spellcasting gets stronger from the Wisdom increase, and you can prep more tools.
- Start planning for a concentration-stabilizing feat at level 8 (the guide recommends War Caster).

### Level 5 — Cleric 5
**Gain**
- **Level 3 spells unlocked**
- **Destroy Undead**
- **Domain spells (always prepared):** Speak with Dead, Slow
- **Racial spell (if Githyanki):** Misty Step
- **Prepared spell:** Glyph of Warding
- **Prepared spell (upgrade from earlier):** Mass Healing Word

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Level 5 is a major spike: you gain stronger control, mobility options, and better area tools.
- When no one needs healing, swap into an area tool for fights with multiple enemies; keep your single-target option ready for priority targets.
- Flex spells depending on encounter and party needs; this build’s strength is adapting.

### Level 6 — Cleric 6
**Gain**
- **Prepared spell:** Beacon of Hope
- Another **Level 3 spell slot**

**Play style (Level 6)**
- You become much better at stabilizing teams under heavy pressure—set up fights so your healing turns recover multiple allies, not just one.

### Level 7 — Cleric 7
**Gain**
- **Domain spells (always prepared):** Confusion, Otiluke’s Resilient Sphere
- **Prepared spell:** Guardian of Faith

**Play style (Level 7)**
- You can run your bonus-action summon and your guardian in tandem.
- Place the guardian in a choke point where enemies have to move through its area to take damage.

### Level 8 — Cleric 8
**Feat**
- **War Caster** (advantage on saving throws to maintain Concentration; reaction casting utility)

**Gain**
- **Prepared spell:** Banishment
- **Subclass feature:** Potent Spellcasting (add Wisdom modifier to cleric cantrip damage)

**Play style (Level 8)**
- This is a stability spike: you run many concentration effects, and this feat helps keep them active.
- Use your single-target removal tool on high-damage threats when your success chance is reasonable.

### Level 9 — Cleric 9
**Gain**
- **Level 5 spell slot unlocked**
- **Domain spells (always prepared):** Dominate Person, Telekinesis
- **Prepared spell:** Mass Cure Wounds
- **Prepared spell:** Flame Strike

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Upgrade your “big heal turn” by pairing your area heal with your other healing tools to recover multiple allies rapidly.
- You can drop your earlier single-target removal tool here because you now have multiple control options.

### Level 10 — Cleric 10
**Gain**
- **Cantrip:** Produce Flame
- **Prepared spell:** Greater Restoration

**Play style (Level 10)**
- You gain higher-end utility to cure severe conditions and keep the party functioning through late-game debuffs.

### Level 11 — Cleric 11
**Gain**
- **Prepared spell:** Planar Ally

**Play style (Level 11)**
- (Not specified in source)

### Level 12 — Cleric 12
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Wisdom**

**Gain**
- **Prepared spell:** Death Ward
- **Prepared spell:** Heroes’ Feast

**Play style (Level 12)**
- You should feel very powerful at this level; this is your full endgame support toolkit for the toughest fights.
