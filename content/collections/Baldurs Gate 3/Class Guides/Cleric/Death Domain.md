## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- An “evil archetype” cleric who fights up close with **martial weapons**, layering **necrotic damage** on weapon hits and spells.
- Plays like a **melee bruiser-caster**: you wade into the pack, maintain a high-impact concentration effect, and punish anything that stays near you.
- The identity is **necrotic pressure + melee burst**, with subclass features that reward being in the danger zone.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Maintain your big melee-friendly concentration effect, then use weapon swings plus necrotic burst features to delete priority targets** while staying in medium armour and shields.

### Party role
- **Frontline damage dealer:** melee weapon attacks augmented by necrotic damage features.
- **Control/support flex:** you still bring cleric utility, plus a bonus-action “summoned attacker” to add pressure and distract enemies.
- **Boss-turn burst:** once you multiclass for martial tempo, you can stack extra actions to spike damage.

### Pros
- Martial weapon proficiency + melee damage focus for a cleric
- Necrotic damage scaling and tools that improve melee spell synergy
- Strong power curve once you reach mid-level cleric features and then pick up fighter burst tools

### Cons
- Weak against undead / necrotic-immune targets
- Needs multiclassing for best melee output
- No heavy armour (medium armour focus)

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: Channel Divinity melee burst feature
- Level 5: unlock higher-tier cleric combat plan around a persistent area effect
- Level 7–8: fighter dip for fighting style + Action Surge
- Level 11: Extra Attack to dramatically increase weapon tempo

---

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Half-Orc
- **Class:** Cleric
- **Subclass:** Death Domain
- **Background:** Folk Hero
- **Skills:** Insight, Persuasion
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 8 / WIS 17 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Half-Orc)
- **Savage Attacks** for extra weapon damage on crits (helps burst).
- **Relentless Endurance** for survivability.
- **Darkvision** quality-of-life.

*Secondary options mentioned in the guide:* **High Half-Elf** (free cantrip choice) or **Duergar Dwarf** (Superior Darkvision + utility).

### Starting setup
- **Armour:** medium armour + shield (build targets DEX 14 for medium armour value).
- **Weapons:** two-handed melee weapon plan is emphasized later, with martial weapon access from the subclass.
- **Stat plan note (from the guide):** this setup assumes Strength will be handled via Strength-boosting consumables/gear rather than base stats.

## Level-by-level progression (Cleric 1 → 6, Fighter 1 → 6)
> Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop, then adjust per encounter.

### Level 1 — Cleric 1 (Death Domain)
**Gain**
- Subclass: **Death Domain**
- Cantrips: Bursting Sinew, Sacred Flame, Guidance, Toll of the Dead
- Prepared spells: Command, Guiding Bolt, Inflict Wounds, Sanctuary
- Subclass features/spells: Martial Weapons proficiency; Reaper; Bone Chill; False Life; Ray of Sickness

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Mix a necrotic cantrip and melee pressure early; use burst spells when you can safely get into range.
- Use Sanctuary defensively on whoever is most likely to get focused.
- Command is your early control button; Guiding Bolt is your ranged “spike” option.

### Level 2 — Cleric 2
**Gain**
- Channel Divinity: Touch of Death (melee hit → spend charge for bonus necrotic damage)
- Spell: Shield

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Your melee hits now have a “burst lever” — use it to finish priority targets.
- Rotate between melee attacks and cantrips depending on range and resources.

### Level 3 — Cleric 3
**Gain**
- Subclass spells: Blindness, Ray of Enfeeblement (always prepared)
- Spell: Spiritual Weapon
- Spell swap noted: swap Shield for Enhance Ability

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Use Spiritual Weapon with your bonus action to add damage and distraction while you stay in melee.
- Blindness and Ray of Enfeeblement are strong “turn shaping” tools—use them when a single enemy is warping the fight.

### Level 4 — Cleric 4
**Gain**
- Feat: Ability Improvement, Wisdom +2
- Cantrip: Thaumaturgy
- Spell: Hold Person

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Your spell accuracy and control reliability improve with higher Wisdom.
- Hold Person becomes a fight-winner vs humanoids (set up crits for melee allies and yourself).

### Level 5 — Cleric 5
**Gain**
- Class feature: Destroy Undead
- Spell: Spirit Guardians
- Spell: Protection from Energy
- Spell swap noted: swap Protection from Poison for Glyph of Warding
- Subclass spells: Animate Dead, Vampiric Touch (always prepared)

**Play style (Level 5)**
- This is the “engine” level: maintain Spirit Guardians (choose necrotic damage) and charge into enemies so they melt around you.
- Use Glyph of Warding for traps/area control and Protection from Energy when an encounter is damage-type heavy.

### Level 6 — Cleric 6
**Gain**
- Spell: Daylight
- Another Channel Divinity charge (subclass scaling)
- Subclass feature at this tier: Inescapable Destruction (spells ignore necrotic resistance)

**Play style (Level 6)**
- You’re harder to shut down in “necrotic-resistant” matchups thanks to the subclass feature.
- Keep the same plan: concentration damage aura + melee burst when a target needs to die now.

### Level 7 — Fighter 1
**Gain**
- Multiclass: Fighter (recommended for weapon fighting, Action Surge, feats)
- Second Wind
- Fighting Style: Great Weapon Fighting

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Your turns get more consistent with better weapon damage rolls and a small self-heal.
- Continue using cleric concentration as your “baseline pressure,” then swing to finish.

### Level 8 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- Action Surge

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Use Action Surge on turns where you can secure a kill or break a boss phase.
- Stack it with your concentration damage plan so every action is “doing damage right now.”

### Level 9 — Fighter 3 (Eldritch Knight)
**Gain**
- Subclass: Eldritch Knight (guide assumption for this route)
- Eldritch Knight selections noted: Booming Blade, Fire Bolt; Shield, Chromatic Orb; Longstrider

**Play style (Level 9)**
- You gain extra defensive/utility options alongside your melee plan.
- Keep focus on melee tempo: use added spells for survivability and positioning while staying in the brawl.

### Level 10 — Fighter 4
**Gain**
- Feat: Savage Attacker

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Your melee damage becomes “smoother” and higher on average because you roll weapon damage twice and take the better result.
- This pairs naturally with a two-handed weapon plan.

### Level 11 — Fighter 5
**Gain**
- Extra Attack

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Your weapon tempo jumps: more swings means more reliable melee damage per turn.
- Continue to open fights by setting your concentration effect first when possible, then use weapon attacks to clean up.

### Level 12 — Fighter 6
**Gain**
- Feat: Alert

**Play style (Level 12)**
- You go earlier and avoid being surprised, which helps you establish your “turn 1 plan” before enemies act.
- Use early initiative to lock down or delete priority threats before they can disrupt your concentration.
