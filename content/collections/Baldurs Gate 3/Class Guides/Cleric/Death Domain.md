- Persuasion: Try to avoid combat through dialogue if possible.

- Crafting: Elixirs and potions are vital, and you need to purchase materials when trading for crafting.
- Reach Level 6: Spend the early part of the game completing every quest to reach level 6 where your power dramatically increases.
- Sell Often: Your carrying capacity will be limited so sell often, and store excessive items in your traveler’s chest.

- Consider Illithid Powers: While it can come with an altered appearance, the powers are powerful and can help you.
- Oils + Elixirs: Combine both oils/coatings and Elixir during combat for a dual benefit.

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- “This guide focuses on the essential aspects of a Death Domain Cleric build… introduced with Patch 8.”
- “Patch 8 of Baldur’s Gate 3 brings a noteworthy update for Clerics with the addition of the Booming Blade cantrip.”
  - “This melee cantrip scales with weapon damage and adds a secondary burst if enemies move, making it a valuable tool for Clerics who want to get up close and personal.”
  - “While any melee-oriented Cleric can benefit from it, the Death Domain Cleric stands out as the ideal candidate.”
- “Despite this new addition, the core playstyles for Clerics remain largely the same.”
- “However, the overall difficulty of the game has increased, especially in Tactician and Honour Modes.”
- “Patch 8 releases 12 new subclasses with the Death Domain Cleric being a strong choice for melee or Necrotic spellcasters.”
