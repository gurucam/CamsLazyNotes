  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Cast Spiritual Weapon (bonus action) and use an action in the same turn.

  - Notes:
    - Spiritual Weapon uses a bonus action and doesn’t cost concentration.
    - Recommend spear form; each form has a different attack that can debuff the enemy.

  - Notes:
    - Mass Healing Word is massive AOE healing and requires a bonus Action rather than an action.
    - Beacon of Hope is used as a concentration spell when you expect heavy damage and you won’t be doing anything but healing each turn.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Channel Divinity Charges: another charge (Preserve Life preferred)
  - Blessed Healer
  - Spell Selection: Glyph of Warding
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):

- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Summon Spiritual Weapon with bonus action on the first turn.

  - Notes:
    - Guardian of Faith can be used in conjunction with Spiritual Weapon; both do not require concentration.
    - If you feel you lack crowd control, swap out Freedom of Movement for Banishment (also use scrolls for crowd control).

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Feat: War Caster
  - Subclass Feature: Divine Strike
  - Spell Selection: Remove Curse
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Shield of Faith
  - Healing Word
  - Command
  - Inflict Wounds
  - Spiritual Weapon
  - Warding Bond
  - Hold Person
  - Mass Healing Word
  - Glyph of Warding
  - Freedom of Movement
  - Remove Curse
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - War Caster helps dramatically maintain concentration which is almost always active for the build.
    - Divine Strike isn’t the priority since the build is a support build and Guiding Bolt fills out single target needs.

  - Warding Bond
  - Hold Person
  - Mass Healing Word
  - Glyph of Warding
  - Freedom of Movement
  - Insect Plague
  - Flame Strike
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Insect Plague requires concentration and does great damage in a massive area, makes the area Difficult Terrain, and imposes Disadvantage on Perception Checks.
    - Flame Strike doesn’t require concentration and is a harder hitting area based spell than Glyph of Warding.

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Subclass Feature: Divine Intervention (one-time only)

  - Glyph of Warding
  - Freedom of Movement
  - Insect Plague
  - Flame Strike
  - Planar Binding
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Divine Intervention: The obvious option is a damage spell; save this for the last boss or something you just cannot complete.

- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- Early priorities:
  - Complete Prologue
  - Recruit Other Companions
  - Reach Druid Grove
  - Sell, Stock up, complete quest
  - Unlock Withers, respec to proper ability score
  - Progress to level 5
  - Reach Underdark and Grymforge
- Quarterstaffs can be combined with shield for extra free spells and Armour Class (AC).
- Rely on cantrips for damage when out of spell slots like Sacred Flame.
- Combine Elixir of Peerless Focus with Potion of Speed (these two stack together for a powerful effect early in BG3).
- 10 gameplay tips and tricks:
  1. Heal Allies: focus on healing allies vs doing damage so your heavy hitters can spend actions and bonus actions doing damage.
  2. Bonus Action Heal: Make the most of your bonus action heal in conjunction with primary action-based heal.
  3. Bless: Cast Bless outside of combat before engaging and get a lot of turns without having to use a turn in combat.
  4. Crowd Control: CC opponents with Blind, and Command to take less damage overall.
  5. Cantrips: Use these when lacking spell slots are you’re not committed to a major offensive spell to keep some spell slots in reserve.
  6. Guiding Bolt: Early on this is your big nuke spell and it’s wise to use it on the first turn when teammates don’t need a heal.
  7. Area vs Single Target: Make sure to get the most out of each spell and if you need multiple players healed, get in position, and use an area-based heal.
  8. Consumables: Take advantage of a Potion of Speed when you need multiple actions per turn.
  9. Health Potions: Make sure teammates are stocked up on healing potions in case they are out of your line of sight or need massive healing themselves.
  10. Range: Make sure to hang out at medium range where you can melee heal or do damage but not too far back to the line of sight of your teammates.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative Life Cleric Build: A “tank” setup that uses the Light subclass and multiclasses into Fighter.
- Focus: debuffing enemies with Radiating Orb via Luminous Armour (obtain this gear in Act 1 and use it throughout the game) while maintaining decent damage with Spirit Guardians.
- Notes: This build can be more complex to master; recommended if you struggle with survival in tough fights.
- Level progression (alternative):
  - Level 1: Cleric (Subclass: Light), Thaumaturgy, Guidance, Sacred Flame, Command, Guiding Bolt, Sanctuary, Healing Word
  - Level 2: Cleric (Shield of Faith)

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- The biggest change to the Cleric comes from the new cantrip Booming Blade (helpful for a melee build).
- The Cleric playstyle of healer, tank, or Radiant damage dealer remains largely unchanged.
- There were some additional buffs to monsters that makes Tactician Mode and Honour Mode more difficult.

### Patch 7
- The Life Domain Cleric received no balance changes in Patch 7 of BG3.
- In this update most builds, combat, and gameplay elements remained untouched.
- Larian Studios’ main focus in this patch is mods and new cinematic endings; the game features a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager.
