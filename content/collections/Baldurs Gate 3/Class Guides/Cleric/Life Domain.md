## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **front-line support healer** in heavy armour: built to **heal, buff, and support allies**, while still dealing “a fair bit” of damage.
- Leans into **healing spells + Disciple of Life + Domain spells** to keep the party stabilized through tougher encounters.
- Uses **out-of-combat utility** like Guidance to influence speech and conversation.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Pre-buff your party → open with damage or summons → triage with bonus-action healing + action heals** while maintaining concentration on your key support spell.

### Party role
- **Healer / stabilizer:** focus on healing allies so heavy hitters can spend actions on damage.
- **Buffer:** Bless and other protection tools to reduce incoming damage and improve team performance.
- **Support damage:** Guiding Bolt early for single-target damage; later adds stronger AoE options and summons.

### Pros
- Great Support Class
- Decent Damage
- Versatility Outside Combat

### Cons
- Low Movement
- Weak Area Damage
- Somewhat Complex

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Spiritual Weapon**
- Level 5: **Mass Healing Word**
- Level 7: **Guardian of Faith**
- Level 8: **War Caster**
- Level 11: **Planar Ally**

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Wood Elf
- **Class:** Cleric
- **Subclass:** Life
- **Background:** Folk Hero
- **Skills:** Medicine, Religion
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 10 / WIS 16 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why Wood Elf)
- Extra movement speed (Fleet of Foot / 10.5 movement)
- Fey Ancestry
- Darkvision

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* Mephistopheles Tiefling (Fire Resistance; Burning Hands at level 3; Flame Blade at level 5).

### Starting setup
- **Preferred armor:** Heavy.
- **Preferred weapon:** One-handed and shield.
- **Early equipment note:** equip a one-handed weapon + shield as soon as possible; quarterstaffs can be combined with a shield for extra free spells and AC.
- **Spellcasting basics:** cantrips are infinite-use; spell slots are finite per long rest; prepared spells can be swapped outside combat; concentration ends if broken.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Complete Prologue
- Recruit Other Companions
- Reach Druid Grove
- Sell, Stock up, complete quest
- Unlock Withers, respec to proper ability score
- Progress to level 5

## Level-by-level progression (Cleric 1 → 12)
> This build emphasizes support and turn-efficiency: use **bonus-action healing** with **action-based heals** or damage, and keep concentration on your most important buff as needed.

### Level 1 — Cleric 1 (Life Domain)
**Subclass**
- **Life Domain**

**Gain**
- **Disciple of Life** (healing spells restore extra hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s level)
- **Domain spells:** Bless, Cure Wounds
- **Cantrips (recommended):** Sacred Flame, Guidance, Thaumaturgy
- **Prepared spells (recommended list at this level):** Healing Word, Cure Wounds, Inflict Wounds, Guiding Bolt, Shield of Faith

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Use Guiding Bolt for damage early; it’s the “main offensive spell” recommendation.
- Combine Healing Word (bonus action) with Cure Wounds (action) for two heals in one turn when needed.
- Use Shield of Faith or Bless as your concentration buff depending on what the fight needs, but you cannot maintain both at once.

### Level 2 — Cleric 2
**Gain**
- **Turn Undead**
- **Preserve Life** (Channel Divinity area heal restoring 3 × Cleric Level hit points to allies; no effect on undead/constructs)
- **Spell (recommended):** Command

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Preserve Life adds a “massive area-based heal” using charges; keep it for when multiple allies need stabilizing.
- Use Command as crowd control, including forcing weapons to drop when overwhelmed.
- Overall gameplay largely stays the same: Guiding Bolt for damage, bonus-action healing as needed.

### Level 3 — Cleric 3
**Gain**
- **Spiritual Weapon** (bonus action summon; does not cost concentration)
- **Domain spells:** Aid, Lesser Restoration

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Spiritual Weapon changes turn economy: use a bonus action summon plus an action spell in the same turn.
- The guide notes you can pre-cast Spiritual Weapon and Bless before combat if you know a fight is about to unfold.
- Treat Spiritual Weapon as extra pressure that can soak damage while you keep healing/buffing priorities.

### Level 4 — Cleric 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Wisdom**

**Gain**
- **Cantrip (recommended):** Blade Ward
- **Spell (recommended):** Warding Bond

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Warding Bond is recommended as a long-duration buff that can be pre-cast outside of combat; expect “more damage and healing” with higher Wisdom.
- Loop stays similar: maintain your best concentration support spell and use bonus-action healing to keep the party afloat.

### Level 5 — Cleric 5
**Gain**
- **Domain spells:** Revivify, Beacon of Hope
- **Spell (recommended):** Mass Healing Word

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Mass Healing Word is highlighted as a strong healing option because it’s large AoE healing with a bonus action.
- Use Beacon of Hope as your concentration spell when you expect heavy damage and will be focused on healing each turn.
- Action + bonus action healing remains your core efficiency pattern (bonus-action heal plus a primary action heal).

### Level 6 — Cleric 6
**Gain**
- Another Channel Divinity charge
- **Blessed Healer** (casting a healing spell of level 1+ on another creature heals you for 2 + the spell’s level)
- **Spell (recommended):** Glyph of Warding

**Play style (Level 6)**
- First turn: summon Spiritual Weapon with bonus action; cast Bless pre-combat or on turn one.
- Use Guiding Bolt or Glyph of Warding for damage; Mass Healing Word plus Preserve Life for big healing moments.
- Before leaving Act 1, visit vendors, stock supplies, and consider Grymforge Adamantine gear.

### Level 7 — Cleric 7
**Gain**
- **Domain spells:** Death Ward, Guardian of Faith
- **Spell (recommended):** Freedom of Movement

**Play style (Level 7)**
- First turn emphasis: drop Guardian of Faith (action) and Spiritual Weapon (bonus action) together; both do not require concentration.
- After setup, prioritize healing and buffs with Bless; use Glyph of Warding for area damage and Guiding Bolt for single-target when the party is stable.
- If you need more crowd control, the guide suggests swapping Freedom of Movement for Banishment; scrolls can cover crowd control without spending prepared slots.

### Level 8 — Cleric 8
**Feat**
- **War Caster**

**Gain**
- **Divine Strike**
- **Spell (recommended):** Remove Curse

**Play style (Level 8)**
- The guide notes Divine Strike isn’t a priority for this support build; Guiding Bolt handles single-target needs.
- War Caster improves concentration consistency, helping you keep important support spells active under pressure.
- Remove Curse is described as niche; Banishment is suggested as a substitute if needed.

### Level 9 — Cleric 9
**Gain**
- **Domain spells:** Mass Cure Wounds, Greater Restoration
- **Spells (recommended):** Insect Plague, Flame Strike

**Play style (Level 9)**
- This level is described as a “big leap in power” due to better AoE healing and damage tools.
- Use Insect Plague when you want large-area damage with difficult terrain and perception penalties (requires concentration).
- Use Flame Strike as a harder-hitting area spell that does not require concentration.

### Level 10 — Cleric 10
**Gain**
- **Divine Intervention** (one-time use)
- **Cantrip (recommended):** Light
- **Spell (recommended):** Planar Binding

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Divine Intervention is described as a one-time spell; the guide suggests saving it for the last boss or something you cannot complete.
- Planar Binding is suggested as decent crowd control when the chance is high enough.
- Otherwise gameplay remains unchanged: heal/buff priority first, cast damage when the party is stable.

### Level 11 — Cleric 11
**Gain**
- Access to the final level 6 spell slot
- **Spell (recommended):** Planar Ally
- **Spell (recommended):** Heal

**Play style (Level 11)**
- The guide prefers using the level 6 slot for Planar Ally after a long rest (does not require concentration and lasts until long rest).
- Heal is described as the best single-target heal in the game (heal 70; removes Blindness and diseases), and you can choose between it and Planar Ally depending on the situation.

### Level 12 — Cleric 12
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Wisdom** (to 20 Wisdom)

**Gain**
- **Spell (recommended):** Heroes’ Feast

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Heroes’ Feast provides utility: cures disease, immunizes to poison, and increases HP for 24 hours.
- The guide notes you should feel very powerful at max level: multiple summons, strong single-target and AoE healing, and strong damage options.
- Use action + bonus action combinations to “burst your team up” in one turn when needed.
