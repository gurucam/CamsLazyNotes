## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- A Cleric subclass that focuses on the power of nature.
- Skilled at healing allies, buffing them for battle, and debuffing enemies, with abilities to control and manipulate the natural world around them.
- Emphasis on nature, survival, buffs, and crowd control, and described as a perfect choice for a nature character archetype.

### Core Playstyle
- Keep your party alive, provide buffs, and deal damage when everyone is topped off on health.

### Party Role
- Support and healing focus with sturdy and durable Cleric healing.
- Uses heavy armour and a shield for a very high Armour Class (AC) and defensive potential.
- Brings utility and control through nature-focused domain spells and crowd control tools.

### Pros
- Heavy armour proficiency and a sturdy support build setup.
- Domain spells are always prepared and added to your spellbook, giving more variety and versatility in spell casting.
- Good domain spells and works well with a support or control centric playstyle.

### Cons
- Cleric’s weak movement speed (noted in relation to why Fleet of Foot helps).
- Limited spell slots early in the game; spell casting can be tough at the start with limited spell slots.
- Barkskin is described as a weak buff spell.

### Power Spikes

  1. Heal Allies: focus on healing allies vs. doing damage so your heavy hitters can spend actions and bonus action doing damage.
  2. Bonus Action Heal: Make the most of your bonus action heal in conjunction with primary action-based heal.
  3. Bless: Cast Bless outside of combat before engaging and get a lot of turns without having to use a turn in combat.
  4. Crowd Control: CC opponents with Blind, and Command to take less damage overall.
  5. Cantrips: Use these when lacking spell slots are you’re not committed to a major offensive spell to keep some spell slots in reserve.
  6. Guiding Bolt: Early on this is your big nuke spell and it’s wise to use it on the first turn when teammates don’t need a heal.
  7. Area vs. Single Target: Make sure to get the most out of each spell and if you need multiple players healed, get in position, and use an area-based heal.
  8. Consumables: Take advantage of a Potion of Speed when you need multiple actions per turn.
  9. Health Potions: Make sure teammates are stocked up on healing potions in case they are out of your line of sight or need massive healing themselves.
  10. Range: Make sure to hang out at medium range where you can melee heal or do damage but not too far back to the line of sight of your teammates.

## Alternative Build Route

  - “The best alternative to the Nature Domain Clerc build is a ‘tank’ setup that debuffs enemies with Radiating Orb via Luminous Armour.”

  - “This build will require the Light Domain subclass, but can be very effective if you are struggling with survivability.”

## Patch Changes

- “The most significant change for Clerics in Patch 8 of BG3 comes with the addition of the Booming Blade cantrip.”
- “Overall, the core Cleric playstyles of healer, tank, or radiant damage dealer remain largely the same.”
- “Recent buffs to enemy strength make Tactician and Honour Mode noticeably more challenging,” and the guide notes you “may wish to use our alternative build for a Cleric with more survivability and strength.”
