## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **sturdy, durable Nature Domain Cleric** with **heavy armour proficiency** and an emphasis on **healing + support** with **nature-flavored control**.
- Plays like a classic **front-line support**: keep the party alive, buff them for battle, and debuff/control enemies, while still contributing damage when safe.
- Leans into **nature spells** (terrain and crowd control) alongside Cleric staples to cover a wide range of encounters and exploration moments.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Stay durable in heavy armour with a shield, keep your party buffed and stabilized, and use nature-themed control tools to shape terrain and shut down enemies when healing isn’t immediately needed.**

### Party role
- **Primary healer / stabilizer:** prioritize healing so damage dealers can spend actions on offense.
- **Buffer:** maintain a key team-wide buff or protective effect depending on the fight.
- **Support control:** use control and terrain tools to reduce incoming damage and disrupt enemy movement.

### Pros
- Durable support playstyle with **heavy armour + shield** baseline.
- Strong spell versatility: healing, buffs, crowd control, and some damage.
- Excellent outside-combat utility with conversation and exploration support options.

### Cons
- Cleric baseline movement can feel weak; positioning matters.
- Many key options compete for concentration, requiring careful choices.
- Can feel resource-limited early due to low spell slots.

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: Bonus-action summon pressure comes online.
- Level 5: Big spike with level 3 spells + subclass control spells.
- Level 9: Major upgrades to mass healing + access to higher-tier terrain/control tools.
- Level 11–12: Long-rest duration powerhouse tools that make you feel extremely strong at max level.

## Level-by-level progression (Cleric 1 → 12)

### Level 1 — Cleric 1
**Gain**
- **Subclass:** Nature Domain
- **Domain spells:** Speak with Animals, Animal Friendship
- **Subclass feature:** Acolyte of Nature (learn a druid cantrip; gain proficiency in Animal Handling, Nature, or Survival)
- **Cantrips (recommended):** Sacred Flame, Guidance, Thaumaturgy
- **Spells (recommended at this level):** Guiding Bolt, Healing Word, Bless, Cure Wounds

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Your goal is to keep the party alive, provide buffs, and deal damage when allies are topped off.
- When you need burst damage early, use your higher-impact single-target option; otherwise rely on cantrips when spell slots are low.
- Use your bonus-action healing together with an action-based heal to get two heals in one turn when needed.
- Maintain high AC with heavy armour + shield to reduce the enemy chance to hit you.
- Use Guidance in dialogue and exploration checks as a key out-of-combat tool.

### Level 2 — Cleric 2
**Gain**
- Turn Undead
- Charm Animals and Plants (subclass feature)
- **Spell (recommended):** Command

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Command is emphasized as strong early crowd control: use it to control weapon users and reduce incoming damage.
- Charm Animals and Plants is highlighted as a useful exploration/questing tool.
- Turn Undead is situational, but very strong when enemies are undead (check enemy type via examine).

### Level 3 — Cleric 3
**Gain**
- **Domain spells:** Spike Growth, Barkskin
- **Spell (recommended):** Spiritual Weapon

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Spike Growth is recommended for choke points to punish enemies moving through a lane and to slow their approach.
- Barkskin is described as a weaker buff compared to having strong armour or other defensive options, but can still have situational value.
- Spiritual Weapon is highlighted as very strong because it is a bonus action, has range and good damage, does not cost concentration, and adds an extra body that can take hits.

### Level 4 — Cleric 4
**Feat**
- Ability Improvement: +2 Wisdom

**Gain**
- **Cantrip (recommended):** Light
- **Spell (recommended):** Lesser Restoration
- The guide also calls out adding a strong single-target control option at this level if you want it prepared.

**Play style (Level 4)**
- +2 Wisdom increases spell effectiveness and gives another prepared spell selection.
- Lesser Restoration is chosen for cleanse utility when needed.
- Overall combat role remains support-first: stabilize, buff, then damage/control when safe.

### Level 5 — Cleric 5
**Gain**
- Destroy Undead
- **Domain spells:** Plant Growth, Sleet Storm
- **Spell (recommended):** Mass Healing Word

**Play style (Level 5)**
- The guide calls this a massive spike: you gain stronger spells plus subclass control tools.
- Mass Healing Word is treated as an upgraded bonus-action AoE heal; the guide notes you can drop the single-target bonus-action heal here if you need to free up preparations.
- Typical flow described:
  - Start fights by applying your key party buff or protective option.
  - Use your bonus-action summon pressure early.
  - On later turns, choose control or damage depending on whether allies need healing.
- When allies are near full, it can make sense to spend turns on area control and single-target damage instead of healing.

### Level 6 — Cleric 6
**Gain**
- **Spell (recommended):** Beacon of Hope

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Beacon of Hope is a concentration spell that maximizes healing output and grants saving throw advantages; the guide recommends swapping into it when heavy incoming damage is expected and most turns are spent healing.
- The guide frames this as a spell you may only cast every few fights, but is extremely valuable in tough encounters.

### Level 7 — Cleric 7
**Gain**
- **Domain spells:** Dominate Beast, Grasping Vine
- **Spell (recommended):** Guardian of Faith
- One level 4 spell slot

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Dominate Beast provides beast control; Grasping Vine provides positional control by dragging creatures.
- Guardian of Faith is recommended as the spell pick because it does not require concentration and acts like a stationary choke-point punish tool.
- The guide notes you can run Guardian of Faith and your bonus-action summon pressure together, and recommends placing Guardian of Faith where enemies must move through its radius.

### Level 8 — Cleric 8
**Feat**
- War Caster

**Gain**
- Divine Strike: Elemental Fury (subclass feature)
- **Spell (recommended):** Banishment

**Play style (Level 8)**
- The guide states Divine Strike: Elemental Fury does not fit this spell-focused support build as well as it fits more martial Cleric archetypes.
- War Caster is chosen because many buffs/debuffs require concentration; it helps maintain effects for maximum impact.
- Banishment is described as one of the best single-target stuns; use it on high-damage threats, and only when your success chance is high enough to justify the risk.

### Level 9 — Cleric 9
**Gain**
- **Domain spells:** Insect Plague, Wall of Stone
- One level 5 spell slot
- **Spell (recommended):** Mass Cure Wounds

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Mass Cure Wounds is described as the go-to selection: a powerful AoE heal.
- The guide emphasizes the “double group heal” turn: combine your action-based AoE heal with your bonus-action AoE heal in the same round.
- Insect Plague and Wall of Stone are described as situational terrain tools; they are useful when playing around chokepoints and terrain manipulation, even if you often have other choices per turn.

### Level 10 — Cleric 10
**Gain**
- Divine Intervention (one-time use)
- **Cantrip (recommended):** Resistance
- **Spell (recommended):** Flame Strike

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Divine Intervention is described as once-per-game; the guide recommends saving it for the hardest fight or an encounter you cannot otherwise complete.
- Flame Strike is recommended as a strong area-based damage option that does not require concentration; the guide cautions against using it into flame-resistant enemies.

### Level 11 — Cleric 11
**Gain**
- One level 6 spell slot
- **Spell (recommended):** Planar Ally (Cambion)

**Play style (Level 11)**
- The guide recommends Planar Ally here and specifically calls out summoning a Cambion for good health, high movement, and big damage.
- Planar Ally stacks with other summons, letting you roam with a “team” until long rest for free damage, utility, and distractions.
- The guide notes two Act 3 quarterstaves that can bypass the “only one level 6 slot” limitation by negating spell slot cost.

### Level 12 — Cleric 12
**Feat**
- Ability Improvement: +2 Wisdom (to 20)

**Gain**
- **Spell (recommended):** Heroes’ Feast
- **Spell (recommended):** Death Ward

**Play style (Level 12)**
- The guide recommends reaching 20 Wisdom and preparing Heroes’ Feast as a long-rest duration team buff.
- The guide describes you as very powerful at this level, especially with long-rest duration tools and the ability to combine bonus-action healing with action-based AoE healing to stabilize the whole party in hard fights.
