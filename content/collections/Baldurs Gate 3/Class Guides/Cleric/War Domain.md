## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- War Domain is a subclass of Cleric that specializes in martial combat, tactics, and divine blessings related to warfare and battle.
- Typically associated with gods of war, valor, and conflict.
- Designed to be a heavily armored front-line damage dealer.
- You will focus on two-handed weapons and using your bonus action for extra attacks.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- This build is a **Heavily Armored Front-line damage dealer** that uses a limited resource to aggressively stack extra melee attacks per turn.

### Party role
- **Frontline Damage/Tank:** High damage threat, while maintaining decent AC.
- **Support/Buffer:** Uses Bless and Spiritual Weapon to buff allies.
- **Damage Spiker:** Uses War Priest and Crusader’s Mantle for massive burst damage.

### Pros
- Very high damage for a Cleric.
- Uses Heavy Armour, one of the few subclasses that gets this proficiency.
- Great utility in the form of Bless, Shield of Faith, and Spiritual Weapon.
- **War Priest** is great for using your bonus action to get extra attacks.

### Cons
- **War Priest** charges are limited, requiring Long Rests often.
- Uses a lot of spell slots early on.
- Divine Strike: Weapon (Level 8) is a bit underwhelming compared to other subclasses.

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 5: **Great Weapon Master** (Feat) and **Spirit Guardians** (Spell).
- Level 9: **Crusader’s Mantle** (Spell).
- Level 12: **Ability Improvement (20 STR)** and maxing out gear.

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- **Pure War Domain Cleric (1 → 12)**
- **Concept:** This build is for players who prefer a single-class experience and want max level spells and a lot of feats.
- **Subclass:** War Domain (The same class, but no multiclassing).
- **Playstyle:** You would replace the **Great Weapon Master** feat with an **Ability Improvement** for **20 Wisdom** to get max spell save DC. This makes your spells more reliable and you become more of a spell-casting Gish.
- **Progression snapshot:** Cleric 12 (Take **Ability Improvement** at level 8 for +2 WIS).
