  - Free Domain Spell: Divine Favour
  - Free Domain Spell: Shield of Faith

  - Heavy Armour Proficiency
  - Martial Weapon Proficiency
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Cure Wounds
  - Healing Word
  - Inflict Wounds
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Use heavy armor, along with a one-handed weapon and shield.
    - The premise of the build is to use spells in combination with martial attacks for damage.
    - At later levels, you can use bonus actions for weapon attacks giving you two great sources of damage.
    - Use your Action for high-powered spells.
    - Use your bonus action for multiple attacks with your weapon (War Priest).
    - Shy away from using cantrips for damage unless you cannot make it in melee range.
    - Take damage for teammates, especially later in the game with much better equipment and very high Armour Class (AC).

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Prepared Spell: Command
  - Turn Undead: Inflicts Turned. Present your holy symbol and pray. Each undead that can see or hear you is forced to flee from you.
  - Guided Strike: Reaction. You gain a +10 bonus to your Attack Roll.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Cure Wounds
  - Healing Word
  - Inflict Wounds
  - Command
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Gameplay remains largely the same with added utility for crowd control with Command.
    - Guided Strike gives a massive +10.
    - Reactions can be toggled via your spell book; it consumes your Channeled Divinity resource (once per fight at this level, replenished on short rest).
    - You don’t want to waste it when a goblin has 2 health remaining.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Prepared Spell: Warding Bond
  - Domain Spell: Magic Weapon
  - Domain Spell: Spiritual Weapon
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Cure Wounds
  - Healing Word
  - Inflict Wounds
  - Command
  - Warding Bond
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - The biggest addition at this level is Spiritual Weapon: a limited-time, 10-turn ally.
    - Spiritual Weapon costs a bonus action, not an action, and does NOT require concentration.
    - Spiritual Weapon can be paired with Spirit Guardians later.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Cantrip: Blade Ward
  - Prepared Spell: Silence
  - Feat: Savage Attacker
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Cure Wounds
  - Healing Word
  - Inflict Wounds
  - Command
  - Warding Bond
  - Silence
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Take Savage Attacker (melee-focused) to do more damage with weapon attacks.
    - Later in levels, use gear that increases overall stat or potions like Hill Giant Strength (+21 strength until a long rest).

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Prepared Spell: Animate Dead
  - Domain Spell: Spirit Guardians
  - Domain Spell: Crusader’s Mantle
  - Destroy Undead (Class feature): When you’ve successfully Turned an undead using Turn Undead, it also takes 4d6 Radiant damage.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Cure Wounds
  - Healing Word
  - Inflict Wounds
  - Command
  - Warding Bond
  - Silence
  - Animate Dead
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Animate Dead consumes a corpse outside of combat and you get a follower to join you in combat until a long rest; it doesn’t cost concentration.
    - Spirit Guardians requires concentration; consider it a go-to spell at this level for when near or engaging with one or more enemies.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Prepared Spell: Glyph of Warding
  - War God’s Blessing (subclass feature): Endow a nearby ally with the glory of your god to grant them a +10 bonus to their Attack Roll.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Cure Wounds
  - Healing Word
  - Inflict Wounds
  - Command
  - Warding Bond
  - Silence
  - Animate Dead
  - Glyph of Warding
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Glyph of Warding adds a range area-based damage spell.
    - War God’s Blessing is useful if playing with another weapon-based damage dealer (and can also be used as an offensive Cleric).

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Prepared Spell: Guardian of Faith
  - Domain Spell: Stoneskin
  - Domain Spell: Freedom of Movement
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Cure Wounds
  - Healing Word
  - Inflict Wounds
  - Command
  - Warding Bond
  - Silence
  - Animate Dead
  - Glyph of Warding
  - Guardian of Faith
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Drop down Guardian of Faith in the middle of the action along with Spiritual Weapon.
  - Notes:
    - Guardian of Faith does great damage in a 10-ft radius but cannot move.
    - Guardian of Faith does not require concentration.
    - Spiritual Weapon (bonus action), Guardian of Faith (action), and Animate Dead (out of combat) can be stacked so you could have three allies possibly fighting for you alongside your high melee damage.

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Prepared Spell: Banishment
  - Divine Strike: Warmaster (subclass feature): Once per turn deal 1-8 in addition to your melee weapons damage.
  - Feat: Alert
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Guiding Bolt
  - Cure Wounds
  - Healing Word
  - Inflict Wounds
  - Command
  - Warding Bond
  - Silence
  - Animate Dead
  - Glyph of Warding
  - Guardian of Faith
  - Banishment
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Use Banishment with one dominant enemy that will likely kill one or more friendlies.
    - Alert is suggested due to low Dexterity and going nearly last in the turn order; it gives a huge advantage in turn order and you can’t be Surprised.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Multiclass: Fighter
  - Second Wind (class feature): a mediocre heal that is useful during the start of the game; bonus action.
  - Protection Fighting Style (class feature): When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose a disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Nothing changes from here on out with multiclassing.
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Multiclassing to Fighter gives access to Action Surge and Fighting Style.
    - The first level of multiclass seems weak; the downside is losing out on level 5 and level 6 spells.
    - If you want to use a two-handed greatsword, Warhammer, etc., take the Great Weapon Fighting Style and take the Great Weapon Master feat at level 12.
    - This build is centered on one hand and shield but you have options now with Fighter class.

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Action Surge: Immediately gain an extra action to use this turn. Once-per-short rest resource.
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Same as before.
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Use Action Surge if you need another attack, crowd control, or just one more action to get that tough enemy down.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Fighter Subclass: Battle Master
  - Superiority Dice (resource): four, recharge on short rest.
  - Manoeuvres (suggested):
    - Disarming Attack
    - Goading Attack
    - Riposte
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Same as before.
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Disarming is perfect for weapon-based characters; if you drop their weapon and pick it up, you essentially destroy their entire build and damage.
    - Goading is great for forcing enemies to attack you.
    - Riposte does extra damage at the expense of a superiority die if someone misses you.
    - If you get the Legendary Shield suggested in the gear section, you can dominate the opposition with reactions.

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Feat: Shield Master
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Same as before – Guiding Bolt, Cure Wounds, Healing Word, Inflict Wounds, Command, Warding Bond, Silence, Animate Dead, Glyph of Warding, Guardian of Faith, Banishment
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Use spells mainly for range damage, crowd control, and summons.
    - Your source of damage is the +10 Attack via Guided Strikes (two times per short rest).
    - Use weapon attacks along with Superiority Dice to disarm enemies.
    - Use your third resource pool for two melee attacks in one turn.
    - Shield Master: +2 bonus to Dexterity Saving Throws while wielding a shield; reaction to diminish a spell’s damage; on a failed Saving Throw, you only take half damage; on a successful Saving Throw, you don’t take any damage.
    - As stated in level 11, use Goading and Riposte for free damage.
    - You can also get an item that boosts your Dexterity up to 18 and in conjunction with Shield Master bonus will be very hard to hit.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
- War Cleric Gameplay & Priorities:
  - During the early phase of BG3, equip a One-Handed weapon and Shield as soon as possible.
  - Rely on cantrips like Sacred Flame for damage when out of spell slots.
  - Look to acquire Elixir of Hill Giant Strength, Potion of Speed, and Oil of Accuracy consumables (these three consumables “stack”).
- Overall priority with the War Cleric build:
  - Complete Prologue
  - Recruit Companions
  - Unlock Withers, respec companions to proper class/ability score
  - Collect the Necromancy of Thay (important in Act 3)
  - Reach Druid Grove
  - Sell, Stock up, complete quests
  - Unlock summons, Scratch, Shovel
  - Progress to level 5
  - Reach Underdark and Grymforge
  - Check all Permanent Bonuses in Act 1 and the best Gear
- 10 gameplay tips and tricks for playing a War Domain Cleric:
  1. Inflict Wounds: this is your highest damage spell early, then transition to more weapon attacks as you progress.
  2. Big Attack: Use a Guided strike for a +10 attack when you need it.
  3. Summon: Use a combination of Spiritual Weapon, Guardian, and Animate Dead for free allies.
  4. Crowd Control: CC opponents with Blind, and Command to take less damage overall.
  5. Bonus Action: Use your bonus action damage dealing with subclass feature.
  6. Guiding Bolt: Early on this is your big nuke spell and it’s wise to use it on the first turn when teammates don’t need a heal.
  7. AOE: use a Smokepowered Bomb or Glyph of Warding for area damage.
  8. Consumables: Take advantage of a Potion of Speed when you need multiple actions per turn.
  9. Scrolls: Keep scrolls of powerful spells with you if you lack Wisdom stat or spell slots.
  10. Range: Backbar a bow just so you can use attacks when out of spell slots.

## Alternative Build Route
- Alternative War Domain Cleric Build (Light Domain tank-style build):
  - Prioritizes durability and battlefield control.
  - Relies on area control and defensive utility, with the Luminous Armour playing a central role.
  - Found early in the Underdark, Luminous Armour releases Radiant Shockwaves around the wearer whenever they deal Radiant damage, allowing your Cleric to act as a front-line buffer who weakens foes simply by standing near them.
  - When combined with Spirit Guardians, this build becomes a zone-denial powerhouse, chipping away at clustered enemies while reducing their combat effectiveness with Radiating Orb.
  - The synergy between Light Domain spells and the Radiating Orb effect creates a highly disruptive presence in melee combat.
  - Excels in high-pressure scenarios and is particularly effective in Tactician or Honour Mode, where controlling the battlefield and limiting enemy damage output are key to survival.
- Alternative build level progression:
  - Level 1 Cleric: Subclass: Light, Thaumaturgy, Guidance, Sacred Flame, Command, Guiding Bolt, Sanctuary, Healing Word
  - Level 2 Cleric: Shield of Faith
  - Level 3 Cleric: Spiritual Weapon
  - Level 4 Cleric: Feat: Alert, Blade Ward, Aid
  - Level 5 Cleric: Spirit Guardians, Swap Healing Word for Mass Healing Word
  - Level 6 Fighter: Multiclass: Fighter, Defence Fighting Style
  - Level 7 Fighter: Action Surge
  - Level 8 Fighter: Subclass: Eldritch Knight, Booming Blade, Fire Bolt, Shield, Thunderwave, Longstrider
  - Level 9 Fighter: Feat: Ability Improvement +2 Wisdom, Chromatic Orb
  - Level 10 Cleric: Multiclass: Cleric, Protection from Energy, Glyph of Warding
  - Level 11 Cleric: Drop Shield of Faith, Add Freedom of Movement and Death Ward
  - Level 12 Cleric: Feat: War Caster, Banishment

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- Patch 8 of Baldur’s Gate 3 introduces the Booming Blade cantrip for Clerics, adding a new layer of power for melee-oriented builds.
- This spell deals bonus damage when enemies move after being struck, making it ideal for aggressive frontline combat.
- While any combat-focused Cleric can benefit, the Death Domain makes the most of it thanks to martial weapon proficiency and bonus necrotic damage, turning them into formidable melee spellcasters.
- The core Cleric roles (healer, tank, and radiant damage dealer) remain largely unchanged.
- With tougher enemies in Tactician and Honour Modes, survivability has become more important than ever.
- For players seeking a sturdier option, the Light Domain offers a strong alternative.

### Patch 7
- The War Domain Cleric subclass received no changes in Patch 7 of BG3.
- Most builds, combat, and gameplay elements remained untouched in Patch 7.
- Larian Studios’ main focus in this patch is mods and new cinematics.
- The game now features a modding toolkit and an in-game mod manager, allowing players to create and install mods directly within the game.
- Our best War Domain Cleric build guide remained unchanged for Patch 7 of Baldur’s Gate 3.
