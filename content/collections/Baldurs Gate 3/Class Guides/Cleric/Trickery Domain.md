## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Prioritize Healing Allies: Concentrate on mending your comrades rather than dealing damage, allowing your heavy hitters to focus on offense.
2. Efficient Bonus Action Healing: Maximize the effectiveness of your bonus action healing by pairing it with your primary action healing.
3. Pre-Battle Blessings: Cast the Shield of Faith before entering combat to save an action.
4. Control the Crowd: Utilize spells like Blind and Command to control opponents, reducing the overall damage your party takes.
5. Cantrip Conservation: When low on spell slots or not committed to major offensive spells, rely on cantrips to preserve your spell slots for crucial moments.
6. Guiding Bolt’s Impact: At the outset, employ Guiding Bolt as your significant damage-dealing spell, ideally on the first turn when allies don’t require healing.
7. Area vs. Single Target: Ensure you extract maximum value from each spell by positioning yourself correctly and employing area-based healing when multiple players need assistance.
8. Leveraging Consumables: When you need multiple actions per turn, take advantage of items like the Potion of Speed.
9. Health Potion Preparedness: Ensure your teammates have healing potions readily available, especially if they are out of your line of sight or require significant healing.
10. Optimal Range: Maintain a medium range where you can provide both melee healing and deal damage without straying too far from your teammates’ line of sight.

## Alternative Build Route

## Patch Changes

- “Despite this new addition, the core playstyles for Clerics remain largely the same.”
- “The overall difficulty of the game has increased, especially in Tactician and Honour Modes.”
- Because of this, the guide notes you “may want to explore alternative Cleric builds that emphasize durability and battlefield control with the Light Domain.”
