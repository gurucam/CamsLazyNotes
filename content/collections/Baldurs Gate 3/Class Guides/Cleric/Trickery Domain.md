## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A domain shared by wicked, chaotic, and mischievous deities alike, those who channel **Trickery** specialise in **deceit and illusion magic**.
- The Trickery Domain specializes in deceit, illusion, and subterfuge.
- You will gain many spells, cantrips, and subclass actions that aid in this gameplay.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- Consider this a **support build** with a variety of **crowd control, illusions, and utility spells** that excels at stunning, crowd-control, and healing.

### Party role
- **Support / Healer:** Focused on support to heal, buff, and protect their allies.
- **Crowd Control:** High utility with spells like Fear, Polymorph, and Dominate Person.
- **Illusionist:** Uses Invoke Duplicity and Mirror Image to distract enemies and buff allies.

### Pros
- You will be able to heal with this subclass very effectively.
- Excels at stunning and crowd-control.
- Great utility for stealth and exploration (Blessing of the Trickster, Pass Without Trace).

### Cons
- A lot of your spells require **Concentration**.
- Spell casting can be tough at the start of Baldur’s Gate 3 with limited spell slots.
- Divine Strike: Poison (Level 8) is a bizarre subclass unlock that won’t fit with our build (we rely on cantrips like Fire Bolt).

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **Mirror Image** + **Spiritual Weapon** (God-tier defensive spell + bonus action summon).
- Level 5: **Fear** + **Animate Dead** (Powerful crowd control + additional ally).
- Level 9: **Level 5 Spells** (Flame Strike, Mass Cure Wounds, Beacon of Hope).

## Character creation

- **Subclass:** Trickery Domain
- **Background:** Folk Hero
- **Skills:** Religion, Insight
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 10 / WIS 16 / CHA 10

### Racial notes (why High Elf)

- **Elven Weapon Training:** You can have longsword proficiency.
- **Darkvision:** Quality-of-life.
- **Fey Ancestry:** Advantage on saves against being Charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.
- *Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **Asmodeus Tiefling** (Hellish Rebuke, Fire Resistance, Darkvision).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** One-handed weapon and **Shield** as soon as possible (Quarterstaffs can be combined with shields for extra free spells and AC).

- **Cantrips:** Sacred Flame, Guidance, Thaumaturgy.
- **Prepared Spells:** Healing Word, Cure Wounds, Command, Guiding Bolt, Spiritual Weapon, Lesser Restoration.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Recruit Companions and unlock Withers to respec them.

- Unlock summons: **Scratch** and **Shovel**.
- Reach **Level 5** and the **Underdark / Grymforge** (check for Adamantine gear).

## Level-by-level progression (Cleric 1 → 12)

### Level 1 — Cleric 1
**Gain**
- **Cantrips:** Sacred Flame, Guidance, Thaumaturgy.
- **Subclass Feature:** Blessing of the Trickster (Grant another creature advantage on Stealth checks).
- **Domain Spells:** Disguise Self, Charm Person.

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Your best combination for healing is **Healing Word** (bonus action) and **Cure Wounds** (action) in one turn.
- **Guiding Bolt** is God-tier damage early and grants Advantage to the next attacker.
- Use **Shield of Faith** (bonus action) to grant +2 AC to a character.

### Level 2 — Cleric 2
**Gain**
- **Turn Undead:** Inflicts Turned; undead are forced to flee.
- **Invoke Duplicity** (Channel Divinity): Summon an illusion to distract enemies; you and allies receive Advantage on Attack Rolls if within 3m of the illusion.

**Play style (Level 2)**
- **Invoke Duplicity** helps a target receiving pressure or going on the offensive by providing Advantage (rolling two D20s).
- **Command** is a mega-powerful crowd control; "Drop" works on weapon users, "Grovel" knocks enemies prone.
- Pick and choose your **Concentration** spell (Bless or Shield of Faith) on turn one, then rely on non-concentration spells.

### Level 3 — Cleric 3
**Gain**
- **Domain Spells:** Mirror Image, Pass Without Trace.
- **Mirror Image:** Create 3 illusory duplicates; each increases AC by 3 (removes on evade).
- **Pass Without Trace:** +10 bonus to Stealth Checks for party.
- **Spiritual Weapon** (Prepared Spell): Summon a floating spectral weapon.

**Play style (Level 3)**
- **Spiritual Weapon** is super powerful because it uses a bonus action, doesn't require concentration, and acts as a distraction/free damage.
- **Mirror Image** is a god-tier defensive spell that skyrockets your AC; use when expecting heavy damage.
- Turn one: Cast offensive/defensive concentration (Bless/Shield of Faith) + Spiritual Weapon (bonus action).

### Level 4 — Cleric 4
**Feat**
- **War Caster:** Advantage on Saving Throws to maintain Concentration; use reaction to cast Shocking Grasp.

**Gain**
- **Light** (Cantrip): Infuse object with light.
- **Lesser Restoration** (Spell): Cure disease, poison, paralysis, or blindness.

**Play style (Level 4)**
- **War Caster** is selected because nearly everything we do requires concentration.
- This prevents breaking concentration, allowing you to get the most out of spells.

### Level 5 — Cleric 5
**Gain**
- **Destroy Undead:** When you successfully Turn an Undead, it takes 4d6 Radiant damage.
- **Domain Spells:** Bestow Curse, Fear.
- **Mass Healing Word:** Heal up to 6 allies (bonus action).
- **Animate Dead:** Create an undead servant from a corpse.

**Play style (Level 5)**
- **Fear** is a very powerful crowd control; enemies drop weapons and cannot move.
- **Animate Dead** summons another ally that lasts until Long Rest; use it on a corpse from a prior battle.
- **Mass Healing Word** gives you upgraded bonus-action healing for the whole team.

### Level 6 — Cleric 6
**Gain**
- **Glyph of Warding:** Inscribe a circle of arcane glyphs; triggers magical effect when stepped on.
- Extra Channel Divinity charge.

**Play style (Level 6)**
- **Glyph of Warding** helps with area damage, which the build has lacked so far.
- Alternate between **Guiding Bolt** and **Glyph** depending on the situation.

### Level 7 — Cleric 7
**Gain**
- **Domain Spells:** Polymorph, Dimension Door.
- **Polymorph:** Transform a creature into a harmless sheep.
- **Guardian of Faith:** Call forth a divine guardian that attacks nearby enemies.

**Play style (Level 7)**
- **Polymorph** is a great single-target stun; use when it has a high chance (70%+) of landing.
- **Guardian of Faith** is an immobile ally; place it on a choke point or funnel where enemies must come.
- You can retreat to make enemies come to the Guardian, using your Animate Dead/Spiritual Weapon as bait.

### Level 8 — Cleric 8
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Wisdom**.

**Gain**
- **Divine Strike: Poison:** Once per turn deal 1-8 Poison damage on melee attack.
- **Death Ward:** Protect a creature from death (remains conscious with 1 HP).

**Play style (Level 8)**
- **Death Ward** is super useful to cast on a melee build (Barbarian/Fighter) to prevent them from going down.
- **Divine Strike Poison** is bizarre and won't fit the build; rely on **Fire Bolt** for free damage instead.

### Level 9 — Cleric 9
**Gain**
- **Domain Spells:** Dominate Person, Seeming.
- **Mass Cure Wounds:** Heal you and nearby allies for 7~28 hit points.
- **Flame Strike:** Pillar of divine fire (area damage).
- **Beacon of Hope:** Allies regain maximum hit points when healed and gain Advantage on WIS/Death saves.

**Play style (Level 9)**
- **Massive power spike**: Unlock Level 5 spells.
- **Flame Strike** serves as a good area base damage spell.
- **Beacon of Hope** + **Mass Cure Wounds** (Action) + **Mass Healing Word** (Bonus Action) allows you to burst up your entire team to full in one turn.

### Level 10 — Cleric 10
**Gain**
- **Divine Intervention:** Invoke your God's aid (Once per game).
- **Banishment:** Temporarily banish target to another plane.
- **Blade Ward:** Cantrip; take half damage from physical attacks.

**Play style (Level 10)**
- **Divine Intervention** is a once-per-game spell; save it for the final fight or a boss you cannot beat.
- **Banishment** is a good single-target stun.

### Level 11 — Cleric 11
**Gain**
- **Planar Ally:** Beseech an otherworldly entity for aid.

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Summon a **Cambion** with Planar Ally; it has good health, movement, and big damage.
- This summon stacks with other summons (Animate Dead, Spiritual Weapon), allowing a "little team" roaming with you.
- Note: You only get one Level 6 spell slot; use **Staff of Spellpower** or **Markoheshkir** to cheese a second cast.

### Level 12 — Cleric 12
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Wisdom** (Target 20 Wisdom).

**Gain**
- **Heroes' Feast:** You and everyone around can't be poisoned, diseased, or frightened. HP increases and gain Advantage on Wisdom Saves.

**Play style (Level 12)**
- **Heroes' Feast** lasts until long rest; combine with Planar Ally if you have items to restore spell slots.
- You should feel very powerful; your burst healing (Beacon of Hope combos) heals the entire team, not just one player.
