## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Inspire Allies: Constantly use Combat Inspiration during and before a fight to give them a massive advantage.
2. Bonus Action: Always exhaust your bonus action with Bardic Inspiration, potion, hide even shove can be beneficial.
3. Environment Protection: Use line of sight, hide, and dash to avoid extra damage from melee aggressors as Bards are not equipped for frontline fighting.
4. Knockback: Having a spell-like Thunderwave is essential to handling pressure from melee targets.
5. Crowd Control: Bards should use single target and area-based control spells to reduce incoming damage.
6. Rest Constantly: Constantly return to camp for a full rest so you enter with a full complement of spell slots.
7. Use Consumables: Use the Potion of Speed in a tough fight to get an extra action per turn for a limited duration.
8. Heal: The goal is to keep damage dealers from having to self-heal or use a bonus action potion, so constantly heal them to keep group damage high.
9. Roleplay: Bards are god-tier RP characters and should mostly be doing dialogue options because of their huge built-in advantages.
10. Use Skills: Check your dice roll score by hovering over a dialogue check to see what gives you the best advantage.
