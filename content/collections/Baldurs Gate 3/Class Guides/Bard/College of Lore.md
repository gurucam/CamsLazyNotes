## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **knowledge-first spellcaster**: a Bard who wins through **wit, dialogue, exploration**, and **versatile magic** rather than raw weapon damage.
- Plays like a **battlefield narrator**—you disrupt enemies, keep allies standing, and solve problems with skills and smart positioning.
- The guide frames Lore Bards as **flamboyant researchers**: excellent out of combat, and a bit fragile when enemies get in your face.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Stay at range, maintain a key concentration effect, spend Bardic Inspiration proactively, and use reaction debuffs to blunt big enemy turns.**

### Party role
- **Controller / utility caster:** shuts down priority targets and reduces incoming damage with crowd control.
- **Skill and dialogue specialist:** huge value in exploration, checks, and roleplay outcomes.
- **Flexible support:** can patch-heal, buff, and stabilize without giving up your main actions every turn.

### Pros
- Strong **utility and support** toolkit (combat + exploration)
- Excellent **crowd control** options and reaction-based disruption
- Great **roleplay / dialogue** character with many skill advantages

### Cons
- **Low survivability** if pressured in melee
- **Concentration-heavy** (you usually want one key effect running)
- Limited armor options (light armor) and generally not a frontline class

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **College of Lore** unlocks (Cutting Words + big skill upgrades)
- Level 5: **Font of Inspiration** (Bardic Inspiration returns on Short Rest)
- Level 6: **Magical Secrets** (adds major off-list spell access)
- Level 10: **Magical Secrets** again (rounds out your endgame toolkit)
- Level 12: Final feat / ASI to finish your Charisma plan (especially with Act 3 helm)

## Level-by-level progression (Bard 1 → 12)

### Level 1 — Bard 1
**Gain**
- **Bardic Inspiration** (bonus action; ally gains **+1d6** to next Attack Roll / Ability Check / Saving Throw; recharges on Long Rest)
- **Astral Knowledge** (Githyanki feature: proficiency in all skills of a chosen ability)
- **Cantrips:** Vicious Mockery, Blade Ward
- **Spells:** Healing Word, Cure Wounds, Tasha’s Hideous Laughter, Thunderwave

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Use **Blade Ward** when you expect weapon pressure and need a defensive turn without spending a spell slot.
- Use **Tasha’s Hideous Laughter** as your early single-target “stop that enemy” button (watch your concentration).
- Use **Healing Word** (bonus action, ranged) to pick allies up while still taking an action.
- Use **Thunderwave** to create space (and for ledge knockbacks).

### Level 2 — Bard 2
**Gain**
- **Spell selection:** Speak with Animals
- **Jack of All Trades** (half proficiency to checks you’re not proficient in)
- **Song of Rest** (party-wide “extra Short Rest” style recovery)

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Keep **Speak with Animals** up for questing and unexpected dialogue outcomes.
- Combat loop stays similar: crowd control + safe positioning + smart bonus-action usage.

### Level 3 — Bard 3
**Subclass**
- **College of Lore**

**Gain**
- **Spell selection:** Heat Metal
- **Skills Improvement:**  
  - **Proficiency:** Stealth, Deception, Intimidation  
  - **Expertise:** Sleight of Hand, Performance
- **Cutting Words** (reaction; spend Bardic Inspiration to apply a penalty to enemy Attack Rolls / Ability Checks / Saving Throws)

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Turn on **“Ask”** for Cutting Words reactions so you don’t waste Bardic Inspiration in low-stakes moments.
- **Heat Metal** is your early “weapon user shutdown” tool—disarm pressure targets and deny them value.

### Level 4 — Bard 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement:** +2 Charisma

**Gain**
- **Cantrip selection:** Friends
- **Spell selection:** Shatter

**Play style (Level 4)**
- The guide’s plan is to build toward **20 Charisma** by level 12, then push higher with Act 3 gear.
- **Friends** is strong for dialogue utility; **Shatter** gives you non-concentration burst AoE damage.

### Level 5 — Bard 5
**Gain**
- **Font of Inspiration** (Bardic Inspiration recharges on Short Rest)
- **Improved Bardic Inspiration** (die increases)
- **Spell selection:** Glyph of Warding

**Play style (Level 5)**
- You can spend Bardic Inspiration more aggressively now because it returns on **Short Rest**.
- **Glyph of Warding** becomes a flexible answer to clustered enemies and setup turns.

### Level 6 — Bard 6
**Gain**
- **Countercharm**
- **Magical Secrets:** Fireball, Counterspell
- **Spell selection:** Stinking Cloud

**Play style (Level 6)**
- This is a major spike: you gain powerful off-list options and a strong reaction answer to enemy spellcasting.
- Use **Stinking Cloud** as a durable area denial tool when fights get chaotic.

### Level 7 — Bard 7
**Gain**
- **Spell selection:** Confusion

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Use **Confusion** when the enemy group is dense and you want their turns to fall apart without needing to out-damage them.

### Level 8 — Bard 8
**Feat**
- **War Caster**

**Gain**
- **Spell selection:** Greater Invisibility

**Play style (Level 8)**
- **War Caster** supports the build’s concentration-heavy identity (your best turns often depend on one effect staying up).
- **Greater Invisibility** enables safer positioning and stronger uptime in difficult fights.

### Level 9 — Bard 9
**Gain**
- **Spell selection:** Mass Cure Wounds

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Adds a stronger “team reset” option when multiple allies are hurt at once.

### Level 10 — Bard 10
**Gain**
- **Skills:** Persuasion, Stealth
- **Cantrip selection:** Light
- **Magical Secrets:** Conjure Elemental, Blight
- **Spell selection:** Planar Binding

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Your toolkit rounds out: you can add summon pressure, single-target damage, and stronger control options based on encounter needs.
- The guide’s emphasis remains: solve fights through **control + tempo**, not standing in melee.

### Level 11 — Bard 11
**Gain**
- **Spell selection:** Eyebite

**Play style (Level 11)**
- **Eyebite** adds a flexible high-level control option—use it when you need a premium action each turn that also pressures priority targets.

### Level 12 — Bard 12
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement:** +2 Charisma

**Gain**
- **Spell selection:** Greater Restoration

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Finish your Charisma plan, then transition to optimizing gear per Act and encounter.
- You now have a full endgame spell list for healing, control, and high-impact choices.
