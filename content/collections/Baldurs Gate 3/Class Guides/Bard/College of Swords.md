### Fantasy / Flavor

- Lead the party in conversation with Charisma-based dialogue Ability Checks.

### Pros
- Melee Damage
- Multiple Attacks
- Crowd Control Enemies

### Cons
- Bonus Action Usage
- Low Mobility
- Lacks Heavy Armour

### Power Spikes
- Level 3: Subclass (College of Swords) and Blade Flourish (Bardic Inspiration changes to weapon-based attacks); medium armour and scimitar proficiency; Fighting Style.
- Level 6: Extra Attack.
- Level 10: Action Surge (multiclass Fighter route).
- Level 11: Fighter Subclass (Battle Master) and Maneuvers / Superiority Dice.

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Bardic Inspiration (class feature): 18m range; bonus action; ally can add +1d6 to their next Attack Roll, Ability Check, or Saving Throw; can be used four times; recover charges by taking a long rest.
  - Cantrips: Vicious Mockery; Blade Ward
  - Spells: Healing Word; Cure Wounds; Tasha’s Hideous Laughter; Thunderwave
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Thunderwave
  - Tasha’s Hideous Laughter
- Play Style:
  - Gameplay at this level revolves around buffing allies with Blade Ward, crowd control with Hideous Laughter, and healing with Healing Word and Cure wounds.
  - You can use Thunderwave to knock back enemies and Vicious Mockery for some damage and debuff.
  - At level 1 you will be wearing light armor and wielding random weapons.
  - During the early phase of BG3, equip a Shortsword or Longsword in the main hand, and a dagger in the off-hand; equip a back bar Hand Crossbow, or Shortbow for ranged damage.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Jack of All Trades: adds half of your Proficiency Bonus to Ability checks that you are not Proficient in.
  - Song of Rest: out-of-combat heal, like a short rest.
  - Spell selection: Faerie Fire
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Thunderwave
  - Tasha’s Hideous Laughter
  - Faerie Fire
- Play Style:
  - Your gameplay remains unchanged here; use Song of Rest to help outside of combat recovery.
  - At level two, you will unlock more level 1 spell slots and can unlearn any spells.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass: College of Swords
  - Heat Metal (spell selection)
  - Fighting Style: Duelling (guide selection)
  - Slashing Flourish (subclass feature): Attack up to 2 enemies at once.
  - Defensive Flourish (subclass feature): Attack defensively, increasing your Armour Class by 4 if you hit.
  - Mobile Flourish (subclass feature): Push target back 6m; afterward, you can Teleport to the target.
  - Proficiencies (subclass feature): Scimitar and Medium Armour
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Thunderwave
  - Tasha’s Hideous Laughter
  - Faerie Fire
  - Heat Metal
- Play Style:
  - Bardic Inspiration changes to Blade Flourish at level 3 with the College of Swords subclass selection; this changes the resource to weapon-based attacks that can be used at range or melee.
  - Slashing, defensive, and mobile flourish all consume Bardic Inspiration.
  - Slashing Flourish is great for area damage (multiple enemies), Defensive is great for increasing your AC, and Mobility is an awesome knockback that can be used to instantly kill enemies off ledges.
  - Rely on your weapon attacks to do damage, and spells to crowd control.
  - Duelling gives you extra damage for a Rapier or Scimitar in your off-hand with just one weapon; rapiers are more common with some very powerful even legendary items in Act 3.
  - Medium armor gives higher AC but caps your AC to +2; later you can get item sets that remove this cap giving you massive AC.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Cantrip: Mage Hand
  - Spell: Shatter
  - Feat: Savage Attacker
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Thunderwave
  - Tasha’s Hideous Laughter
  - Faerie Fire
  - Heat Metal
  - Shatter
- Play Style:
  - Savage Attacker will increase your damage significantly; Shatter can be useful as a range damage-dealing tool; Mage Hand is purely for utility.
  - The gameplay remains the same at this level, and not much changes until level 6.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Improved Bardic Inspiration: Bardic Inspiration increases from 1d6 to 1d8 on attack rolls.
  - Font of Inspiration: regain all Bardic Inspiration after a Short or Long Rest.
  - Spell: Stinking Cloud
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Thunderwave
  - Tasha’s Hideous Laughter
  - Faerie Fire
  - Heat Metal
  - Shatter
  - Stinking Cloud
- Play Style:
  - Stinking Cloud is in a massive 8m radius and creates a huge cloud that constantly makes Dex check to see if enemies cannot use actions; it essentially shuts down an entire area (friend or foe) from taking action.
  - At level 5, you get another area-based crowd control Stinking Cloud.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Counter Charm: you and any allies within 9m have Advantage on Saving Throws against being Charmed or Frightened.
  - Extra Attack
  - Spell: Glyph of Warding
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Thunderwave
  - Tasha’s Hideous Laughter
  - Faerie Fire
  - Heat Metal
  - Shatter
  - Stinking Cloud
  - Glyph of Warding
- Play Style:
  - Level 6 gives Extra Attack making one attack deliver two attacks increasing damage radically.
  - The Bard lacks bonus action utility; use your bonus action for potions, consumables, etc., and action for pure damage with weapons or spells for CC.
  - Ending Act 1 notes: check in with merchants and stock up on camp and alchemy supplies; don’t miss permanent bonuses in Act 1; Grymforge has powerful armor and weapons (Adamantine) that can aid you well into Act 3; consider crafting at least one thing there before transitioning to Act 2 (where you won’t be able to return).

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Spell: Polymorph
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Thunderwave
  - Tasha’s Hideous Laughter
  - Faerie Fire
  - Heat Metal
  - Shatter
  - Stinking Cloud
  - Glyph of Warding
  - Polymorph
- Play Style:
  - Polymorph is a great single-target CC; use this on the enemy’s primary damage dealer only if the percentage to land is 60% or higher (otherwise it’s not worth the risk compared to losing out on two attacks with Extra Attack).

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Spell: Greater Invisibility
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Dexterity) to give a total of 18
- Prepared Spells (if applicable):
  - Healing Word
  - Cure Wounds
  - Thunderwave
  - Tasha’s Hideous Laughter
  - Faerie Fire
  - Heat Metal
  - Shatter
  - Stinking Cloud
  - Glyph of Warding
  - Polymorph
  - Greater Invisibility
- Play Style:
  - At this level, you get a utility spell and more Dexterity which will help with damage and landing attacks.
  - Past this point, Bard levels are described as “lackluster,” and the guide leans into multiclassing for action-based combat.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Multiclass: Fighter
  - Second Wind: heal yourself for 1d10 + Fighter Level hit points.
- Play Style:
  - The guide chooses Fighter (Battle Master Fighter route) because it will give Action Surge and “two attacks per short rest,” and with Extra Attack you can take a lot of actions per turn.
  - Your spells remain unchanged from this point forward; use them for utility mainly.
  - Bonus Action: use for Bardic Inspiration or consumables (you still have 5 Bardic charges, which regenerate on short rest).

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Action Surge: immediately gain an extra action to use this turn.
- Play Style:
  - Action Surge allows another free turn once every short rest; with Extra Attack that means four attacks and one bonus action per turn.
  - Use Action Surge wisely: wait for a target to be vulnerable or nearly at death, then use Action Surge and finish the target off.
  - Do not use Action Surge on your first turn; be precise with it when you need to press the action, retreat, off-heal, or your party will die.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Fighter Subclass: Battle Master
  - Maneuvers: Feinting Attack; Riposte; Precision Attack
  - Superiority Dice (resource; short rest recharges Superiority Die and Action Surge)
- Play Style:
  - Feinting Attack uses both your action and bonus action to attack with Advantage and deal an additional 1d8 damage.
  - Riposte: when a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, expend a superiority die to retaliate with a strike that deals an additional 1d8 damage.
  - Precision Attack: spend a Superiority Die to add it to the result of an Attack Roll.
  - The guide describes using maneuvers for extra damage and bonus damage usage (not crowd control, since you have that alongside healing).

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Dexterity)
- Play Style:
  - The guide states that at this level you select a +2 Dexterity bonus and reach 20 if you follow the guide.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Inspire Allies: Constantly use Combat Inspiration during and before a fight to give them a massive advantage.
2. Bonus Action: Always exhaust your bonus action with Combat Inspiration, potion, hide even shove can be beneficial.
3. Environment Protection: Use line of sight, hide, and dash to avoid extra damage from melee aggressors as Bards are not equipped for frontline fighting.
4. Knockback: Having a spell-like Thunderwave is essential to handling pressure from melee targets.
5. Crowd Control: Bards should use single target and area-based control spells to reduce incoming damage.
6. Rest Constantly: Constantly return to camp for a full rest so you enter with a full complement of spell slots.
7. Use Consumables: Use the Potion of Speed in a tough fight to get an extra action per turn for a limited duration.
8. Heal: The goal is to keep damage dealers from having to self-heal or use a bonus action potion, so constantly heal them to keep group damage high.
9. Roleplay: Bards are god-tier RP characters and should mostly be doing dialogue options because of their huge built-in advantages.
10. Use Skills: Check your dice roll score by hovering over a dialogue check to see what gives you the best advantage.
