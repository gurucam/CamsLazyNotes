## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **weapon-first Bard**: you fight like a duelist, using **Blade Flourishes** to turn inspiration into damage and defense.
- Plays as a “**melee damage dealer with utility**”—you rely on weapon pressure, then use control/utility magic when it wins the turn.
- Once **Extra Attack** arrives, your turns start to feel like a true martial’s, while still keeping Bard flexibility out of combat.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Close in with a one-handed duelist setup, spend inspiration on weapon flourishes, and use your magic for control/utility while your attacks carry the damage.**

### Party role
- **Frontline duelist DPS:** consistent weapon damage that scales hard once Extra Attack is online.
- **Control assist:** uses crowd control to reduce incoming damage and create safe kill windows.
- **Face / RP lead:** high Charisma + social skill focus makes you ideal for dialogue and exploration checks.

### Pros
- Strong **melee damage**
- **Multiple attacks** once your subclass progression ramps
- Access to **crowd control** and utility alongside weapon pressure

### Cons
- Bonus-action economy can feel tight (you’ll often want Bardic Inspiration or consumables)
- Lower mobility early if you don’t solve it with gear/positioning
- No heavy armour (you lean on medium armour + itemization)

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **College of Swords** + **Blade Flourishes** + Fighting Style
- Level 5: **Font of Inspiration** (Bardic Inspiration returns on Short Rest) + access to stronger spell tiers
- Level 6: **Extra Attack** (major damage jump)
- Level 10: **Action Surge** (burst turns)
- Level 11: **Battle Master** maneuvers (more damage tools + reactions)
- Level 12: **+2 Dexterity** (cap Dexterity at 20 if following this route)

## Level-by-level progression (Bard 1 → 8, Fighter 1 → 4)
> This build is very “turn-plan” driven. Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop.

### Level 1 — Bard 1
**Gain**
- **Bardic Inspiration** (bonus action; 18m range; ally adds +1d6 to next Attack Roll, Ability Check, or Saving Throw; charges restore on Long Rest)
- **Cantrip: Vicious Mockery** (Psychic damage + disadvantage on target’s next attack)
- **Cantrip: Blade Ward** (resistance to Bludgeoning/Piercing/Slashing from weapon attacks)
- **Spell: Healing Word** (ranged bonus-action heal)
- **Spell: Cure Wounds** (touch heal; stronger but costs an action)
- **Spell: Tasha’s Hideous Laughter** (single-target control; Prone; concentration)
- **Spell: Thunderwave** (AoE damage + knockback)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Early fights are about **staying safe while enabling the party**: control a key enemy, heal to prevent downs, and debuff with cantrips.
- Use **Thunderwave** to punish melee pressure or knock enemies off ledges.
- You’re not a weapon carry yet—your big weapon identity arrives with your subclass.

### Level 2 — Bard 2
**Gain**
- **Jack of All Trades** (add half proficiency to ability checks you aren’t proficient in)
- **Song of Rest** (out-of-combat recovery; “extra short rest” feel)
- **Spell: Faerie Fire** (targets visible; attacks against them have advantage; concentration)

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Loop is similar: **control + utility + recovery**.
- Use **Faerie Fire** when advantage will swing a fight (especially for party members who love advantage).

### Level 3 — Bard 3 (College of Swords)
**Subclass**
- **College of Swords**

**Gain**
- **Fighting Style: Duelling** (one-handed, no off-hand weapon: +2 damage)
- **Blade Flourish** (Bardic Inspiration becomes weapon-based Flourishes)
  - **Slashing Flourish** (hit up to 2 enemies)
  - **Defensive Flourish** (extra damage + up to +4 AC if you hit)
  - **Mobile Flourish** (push target back 6m; then teleport to the target)
- **Proficiencies:** Scimitar, **Medium Armour**
- **Spell: Heat Metal** (punish metal weapon/armour users with disadvantage/drops)

**Play style (Level 3)**
- This is where the build **turns into a weapon Bard**: lean into weapon attacks and spend Bardic Inspiration on **Flourishes**.
- **Slashing** for clustered fights, **Defensive** to spike AC when you expect to be targeted, **Mobile** for knockback kills or repositioning.
- Track Bardic Inspiration like spell slots: **use it aggressively**, then rest to refill.

### Level 4 — Bard 4
**Feat**
- **Savage Attacker** (roll melee damage dice twice; take the higher)

**Gain**
- **Cantrip: Mage Hand** (utility)
- **Spell: Shatter** (AoE damage; strong vs inorganic targets)

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Your melee damage becomes more consistent with **Savage Attacker**.
- Gameplay stays mostly the same—your next major combat jump is Level 6’s Extra Attack.

### Level 5 — Bard 5
**Gain**
- **Font of Inspiration** (Bardic Inspiration returns on **Short Rest**)
- **Improved Bardic Inspiration** (+1d8; later +1d10)
- **Spell: Stinking Cloud** (large area control; prevents actions on failed saves)

**Play style (Level 5)**
- You can now spend Bardic Inspiration more freely because it recharges on **Short Rest**.
- Use **Stinking Cloud** to shut down a large zone when you need breathing room or to isolate threats.

### Level 6 — Bard 6
**Gain**
- **Countercharm** (advantage vs Charmed/Frightened for you and allies within 9m)
- **Extra Attack** (two attacks per Attack action)
- **Spell: Glyph of Warding** (trap or targeted AoE; choose damage/control effect)

**Play style (Level 6)**
- Your damage spikes: your default turn becomes **Attack action (two attacks) + Flourish when needed**.
- Your weak spot is still bonus-action utility—plan on using bonus actions for **Bardic Inspiration**, **potions**, or other consumables.

### Level 7 — Bard 7
**Gain**
- **Spell: Polymorph** (single-target hard control)

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Use **Polymorph** on a high-impact enemy when your success chance is high—missing costs you a full action you could have spent attacking.
- If the fight is already under control, keep swinging—your weapon pressure is your identity.

### Level 8 — Bard 8
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Dexterity** (to reach 18 Dexterity)

**Gain**
- **Spell: Greater Invisibility** (utility + offense/defense; requires repeated stealth checks)

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Dexterity improves **hit chance, damage, and defense**.
- At this point, Bard levels don’t add much to the weapon plan—this guide pivots to Fighter for more actions and burst.

### Level 9 — Fighter 1
**Multiclass**
- **Fighter 1**

**Gain**
- **Second Wind** (bonus-action self-heal)

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Bonus action is still valuable; **Second Wind** gives you a reliable self-stabilize button.
- Keep using Bardic Inspiration + Flourishes as needed; you’re setting up Action Surge next.

### Level 10 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- **Action Surge** (gain an extra action this turn; recharges on Short Rest)

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Save **Action Surge** for turns where it matters: finish a priority target, recover tempo, or secure a kill window.
- With Extra Attack, Action Surge often means **four attacks in one turn** (plus bonus action).

### Level 11 — Fighter 3 (Battle Master)
**Subclass**
- **Battle Master**

**Gain**
- **Maneuvers:** Feinting Attack, Riposte, Precision Attack
- **Superiority Dice** (resource for maneuvers; recharges on Short Rest)

**Play style (Level 11)**
- **Feinting Attack** uses action + bonus action to attack with advantage and add damage—great when your bonus action would otherwise be “empty.”
- **Riposte** turns enemy misses into free damage; it shines when your AC is high.
- **Precision Attack** helps land key hits without spending an action.

### Level 12 — Fighter 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Dexterity** (to reach 20 Dexterity)

**Play style (Level 12)**
- You’re fully online: strong Dexterity scaling, Extra Attack, Flourishes, and Fighter burst tools.
- From here, focus on completing your gear set and using consumables to amplify your best turns.
