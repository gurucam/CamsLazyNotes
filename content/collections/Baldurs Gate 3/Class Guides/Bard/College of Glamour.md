  - Reach Level 6: Spend the early part of the game completing every quest to reach level 6 where your power dramatically increases.
  - Sell Often: Your carrying capacity will be limited so sell often, and store excessive items in your traveler’s chest.
  - Stealth: Start combat in stealth if at all possible to trigger the Surprise status effect.
  - Consider Illithid Powers: While it can come with an altered appearance, the powers are powerful and can help you.

  - Persuasion: Try to avoid combat through dialogue if possible.
