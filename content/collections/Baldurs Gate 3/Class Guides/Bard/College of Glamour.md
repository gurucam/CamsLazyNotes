## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **crowd-control “star” Bard** who buffs allies with Glamour and **turns attackers Charmed** when they hit your inspired friends.
- Leans into **melee + magic synergy** in Patch 8 by pairing **Booming Blade** with **Shadow Blade** (Sorcerer multiclass) for big Psychic damage.
- Plays like a **dialogue specialist** who can still step into melee, lock down enemies, and keep the party moving with utility spells.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Control first (Charm/Fear/Command), then burst in melee with Booming Blade + Shadow Blade**, using Sorcerer metamagic and consumables to scale.

### Party role
- **Support / controller:** Bardic Inspiration + Mantle of Inspiration temp HP + Charm retaliation on melee hits.
- **Debuffer:** Fear, Heat Metal, Stinking Cloud, Tasha’s Hideous Laughter.
- **Hybrid striker:** Shadow Blade + Booming Blade for melee burst while still carrying strong utility.

### Pros
- Excellent **crowd control** tools and team support
- Very strong in **dialogue** (Charisma focus)
- Flexible: can play **melee or ranged** depending on gear/spells

### Cons
- **Weak spell selection** early compared to dedicated casters (per the guide)
- Subclass features are **limited** in number (per the guide)
- Melee plan benefits heavily from **setup** (Shadow Blade + buffs/consumables)

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 3: **College of Glamour** (Mantle of Inspiration)
- Level 5: **Font of Inspiration** (Bardic Inspiration on Short Rest) + stronger spell tier access
- Level 6: **Mantle of Majesty: Command** + Fear added to the kit
- Level 9: **Shadow Blade** online + metamagic depth (Quickened)
- Level 12: **Haste** (more actions = more pressure)

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** High Half-Elf
- **Class:** Bard
- **Subclass:** College of Glamour
- **Background:** Entertainer
- **Skills:** Athletics, Intimidation, Persuasion
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 14 / INT 8 / WIS 10 / CHA 17

### Racial notes (why High Half-Elf)
- **Free Cantrip** (the guide uses this to take **Booming Blade**)
- **Fey Ancestry** (advantage vs being Charmed)
- **Darkvision** + **Civil Militia** (from race features listed)

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **Wood Half-Elf** (Longbow proficiency, Darkvision, higher movement speed).

### Starting setup
- **Cantrips:** Booming Blade (race bonus), Vicious Mockery, Friends
- **Spells:** Thunderwave, Longstrider, Dissonant Whispers, Charm Person
- **Gear direction:** light armour + DEX; keep a **one-handed weapon + shield** option for melee Booming Blade gameplay (race dependent).

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- **Pre-buff** with Longstrider often.
- Use Bardic Inspiration to support allies (and to fuel your subclass features later).
- Plan to collect **Auntie Ethel’s Hair** in Act 1 to push Charisma to 18.
- The endgame goal is **Shadow Blade in main hand + Elixir of Strength + Booming Blade**, ideally with **Resonance Stone** later for doubled Psychic damage.

## Level-by-level progression (Bard 1 → 6, Sorcerer 1 → 6)
> This build is very “setup → control → burst” driven. Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop.

### Level 1 — Bard 1
**Gain**
- **Bardic Inspiration** (bonus action, 18m range): ally adds **+1d6** to next Attack Roll, Ability Check, or Saving Throw (4 uses; recovers on Long Rest)
- **Cantrips:** Booming Blade (race bonus), Vicious Mockery, Friends
- **Spells:** Thunderwave, Longstrider, Dissonant Whispers, Charm Person

**Play style (Level 1)**
- In melee: **Booming Blade** with a one-handed weapon (and shield if available).
- At range: use your extra cantrip option (the guide notes Fire Bolt as a ranged filler option).
- Pre-buff **Longstrider**, and spend bonus actions on **Bardic Inspiration** to stabilize fights.

### Level 2 — Bard 2
**Gain**
- **Song of Rest** (revitalize party like a Short Rest)
- **Jack of All Trades** (add half proficiency to non-proficient Ability Checks)
- **Spell:** Tasha’s Hideous Laughter

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Add **Tasha’s** as a control tool to drop key targets Prone and deny turns.
- Keep the Level 1 loop: Booming Blade in melee, Inspiration for team tempo.

### Level 3 — Bard 3 (College of Glamour)
**Subclass**
- **College of Glamour**

**Gain**
- **Mantle of Inspiration**: imbue **2 allies** with vigour; grant **5 temp HP**; if they’re hit by a **melee** attack, the attacker becomes **Charmed**
- **Spell:** Heat Metal
- **Spell swap:** swap Thunderwave → Cloud of Daggers

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Use **Mantle of Inspiration** early in fights to pad allies and punish melee attackers with Charm.
- **Heat Metal** targets carrying weapons/armour; **Cloud of Daggers** for area damage and choke points.

### Level 4 — Bard 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Charisma**

**Gain**
- **Cantrip:** Mage Hand
- **Spell:** Invisibility

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Use **Invisibility** before combat to start from stealth and trigger Surprise, then open with Booming Blade.
- Your game plan is still CC + support, but with stronger spell DCs from Charisma.

### Level 5 — Bard 5
**Gain**
- **Bardic Inspiration** improves (die increases to **1d8**)
- **Font of Inspiration** (recover Bardic Inspiration on **Short Rest**)
- **Spell:** Glyph of Warding
- **Spell swap:** swap Cloud of Daggers → Stinking Cloud

**Play style (Level 5)**
- Drop **Glyph of Warding** (choose elements as needed) for flexible AoE.
- Use **Stinking Cloud** on choke points so enemies lose actions while your party attacks safely.

### Level 6 — Bard 6
**Gain**
- **Mantle of Majesty: Command** (special Command as a subclass feature; targets that are Charmed automatically fail their Save; Recharge: Long Rest)
- **Countercharm** (you and allies within 9m have Advantage vs Charmed/Frightened)
- **Spell:** Fear

**Play style (Level 6)**
- **Fear** is your major control button: disarm and force enemies to flee.
- Use **Command** through Mantle of Majesty to reposition/disable threats—especially strong against already-Charmed targets.

### Level 7 — Sorcerer 1 (Shadow Magic)
**Multiclass**
- **Sorcerer 1** → **Shadow Magic**

**Gain**
- **Subclass:** Shadow Magic
  - **Eyes of the Dark** (see in the dark up to 24m)
  - **Strength of the Grave** (when you’d drop to 0 HP, you can remain at 1 instead of downed)
- **Cantrips:** Light, Ray of Frost, Friends, Minor Illusion (the guide notes you can take Booming Blade here if you missed it)
- **Spells:** Shield, Chromatic Orb

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Add **Shield** as a reaction defensive spike (+5 AC; also negates Magic Missile damage).
- Chromatic Orb gives flexible damage types and surface creation when you need ranged pressure.

### Level 8 — Sorcerer 2
**Gain**
- **Sorcery Points**
- **Metamagic:** Twinned Spell, Extended Spell
- **Spell:** Magic Missile

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Use **Twinned** for single-target pressure (the guide notes twinning Booming Blade when possible).
- Use **Extended** to stretch durations of control/surface spells (e.g., Stinking Cloud) and to enable stronger “cloud + fight inside it” setups.

### Level 9 — Sorcerer 3
**Gain**
- **Subclass feature:** Darkness (create magical darkness that heavily obscures/blinds; prevents ranged attacks into/out of it)
- **Subclass feature:** Eye of the Darkness (similar function via sorcery points)
- **Metamagic:** Quickened Spell (Action spells become Bonus Action)
- **Spell:** Shadow Blade (2d8 Psychic shortsword)
- **Spell swap:** swap Magic Missile → Mirror Image

**Play style (Level 9)**
- Cast **Darkness** on yourself and fight inside it (you can still see through it with Eyes of the Dark).
- Summon **Shadow Blade** (bonus action) and pair it with **Booming Blade** (Twinned if possible) for huge melee damage.
- Use **Mirror Image** for survivability when you’re committing to melee.

### Level 10 — Sorcerer 4
**Feat**
- **Alert** (+4 initiative; can’t be Surprised)

**Gain**
- **Cantrip:** Bone Chill
- **Spell:** Misty Step

**Play style (Level 10)**
- The guide emphasizes keeping **Elixir of Strength** running to make the melee combo work.
- **Misty Step** fixes positioning problems—teleport to stay on target or to escape when threatened.

### Level 11 — Sorcerer 5
**Gain**
- **Spell:** Fireball
- **Spell swap:** swap Chromatic Orb → Counterspell

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Fireball gives you a clean answer to clustered enemies.
- **Counterspell** protects your team and keeps your control plan from being disrupted by enemy casters.

### Level 12 — Sorcerer 6
**Gain**
- **Subclass feature:** Hound of Ill Omen (summon Nimbus, a shadow mastiff)
- **Spell:** Haste

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Use **Haste** to scale your action economy—more actions means more pressure (spells or melee turns).
- When a fight is about deleting one threat: set up **Shadow Blade → Booming Blade**, then leverage Haste to keep tempo while your control spells hold the rest.
