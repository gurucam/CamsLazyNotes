## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Bardic Inspiration
  - Cantrips: Vicious Mockery, Blade Ward
  - Spells: Healing Word, Cure Wounds, Tasha’s Hideous Laughter, Thunderwave
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Gameplay revolves around buff allies with Bardic Inspiration, Blade Ward, crowd control with Hideous Laughter, and healing with Healing Word and Cure Wounds.
    - Use Thunderwave to knock back enemies and Vicious Mockery for some damage and debuff.
    - Bard doesn’t pick a subclass until level 3, so start off the game by wearing Light Armour and wielding miscellaneous weapons.

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Jack of All Trades
  - Song of Rest
  - Spell: Faerie Fire
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Song of Rest provides an out-of-combat heal, like a short rest.
    - The gameplay remains unchanged here; use Song of Rest to help outside of combat recovery.

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Subclass: College of Valour
  - Combat Inspiration
  - Gain Proficiency: Medium Armour, Shield, Martial Weapon
  - Spell: Heat Metal
  - Pick two more skills you are proficient in (dialogue ability checks highly likely to succeed; “don’t expect any performance gain”)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: When you find a difficult fighter, pop Heat Metal first turn.
    - Turn 2+: Crowd control and deal with the most threatening target.
  - Notes:
    - Switch the build to Medium armor with a sword and shield for more Armour Class (AC).

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (+2 Charisma), reaching 18 Charisma
  - One new spell
  - Another Cantrip
  - Spell: Crown of Madness
  - (Alternative route noted): Feat Magic Initiate: Warlock (unlocks Eldritch Blast and Hex)
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Ability Improvement is taken to increase the effectiveness of your spells.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Bardic Inspiration enhanced (1d6 to 1d8 on attack rolls)
  - Gain all Bardic Inspiration on a short rest
  - Spell: Glyph of Warding
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Glyph of Warding is taken because up until this point the Bard has very little area damage.
    - Depending on if you took a lot of control spells early, you can add more damage with Glyph.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Countercharm
  - Extra Attack
  - Spell: Stinking Cloud
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Bard has a lot of crowd control at this level, some of which requires concentration.
    - Pick the most important form of CC when needed.

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Spell: Confusion
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Confusion is one of the strongest areas of crowd control in the game; massive radius affecting multiple enemies, which often attack each other.
    - Confusion requires concentration; you can swap out previously used control spells using the replace spell function if you have too many.

### Level 8
- Gain:
  - Feat: War Caster
  - Spell: Dimension Door
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - War Caster: Advantage on Saving Throws to maintain Concentration on a spell; reaction to cast Shocking Grasp at a target moving out of melee range.
    - Dimension Door: Teleport yourself and up to 1 adjacent ally to a place you can see (ally cannot be larger than medium); can be used out of combat as well to reach places jump normally wouldn’t work.

### Level 9
- Gain:
  - Spell: Mass Cure Wounds
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Mass Cure Wounds: Up to 6 creatures regain 3d8 + Spell Ability modifier; acts as a massive group heal rather than single target.
    - Can combine with bonus action Healing Word and double the heal potential within one turn.

### Level 10
- Gain:
  - Cantrip: Minor Illusion
  - Spell: Seeming
  - Skill Expertise: select Intimidation and Persuasion
  - Improved Bardic Inspiration: bonus increases to +1d10
  - Magical Secrets: take Conjure Elemental and Blight
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Conjure Elemental: Summon an elemental ally; does not require concentration; can pre-cast before combat after a long rest and keep the elemental the entire time.
    - Blight: 9m range, dealing 8d8 necrotic damage; helps with single-target damage and a different elemental type.

### Level 11
- Gain:
  - Multiclass: Fighter
  - Fighting Style: Protection (must be wielding a shield; reaction to impose disadvantage on an attack roll against a nearby ally)
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - At levels 11 and 12, the Bard’s power significantly drops; level 6 spells are described as minimal/very weak, so this build multiclasses into Fighter for Action Surge.

### Level 12
- Gain:
  - Fighter: Action Surge
  - (If not multiclassing as advised): At level 12 Bard, increase Charisma by +2 to 20 overall
- Play Style:
  - Notes:
    - Action Surge gives an extra action and recharges on short rest; allows you to cast another spell, attack, dash, etc.

## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Inspire Allies: Constantly use Combat Inspiration during and before a fight to give them a massive advantage.
2. Bonus Action: Always exhaust your bonus action with Combat Inspiration, potion, hide even shove can be beneficial.
3. Environment Protection: Use line of sight, hide, and dash to avoid extra damage from melee aggressors as Bards are not equipped for frontline fighting.
4. Knockback: Having a spell-like Thunderwave is essential to handling pressure from melee targets.
5. Crowd Control: Bards should use single target and area-based control spells to reduce incoming damage.
6. Rest Constantly: Constantly return to camp for a full rest so you enter with a full complement of spell slots.
7. Use Consumables: Use the Potion of Speed in a tough fight to get an extra action per turn for a limited duration.
8. Heal: The goal is to keep damage dealers from having to self-heal or use a bonus action potion, so constantly heal them to keep group damage high.
9. Roleplay: Bards are god-tier RP characters and should mostly be doing dialogue options because of their huge built-in advantages.
10. Use Skills: check your dice roll score by hovering over a dialogue check to see what gives you the best advantage.
