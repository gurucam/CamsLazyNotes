## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **battle-hardened support Bard**: you stand near the front in medium armour and a shield, keeping allies steady while disrupting enemies.
- Plays like a “**party captain**”: you spend bonus actions empowering teammates, then use your actions for control, emergency heals, or positioning.
- In and out of combat, you’re the **social lead**—leaning on Charisma and dialogue skills to steer encounters.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Use bonus actions to empower allies, then spend actions to control space and stabilize the team**, turning messy fights into clean wins through tempo.

### Party role
- **Support engine:** constant buffs and recovery so damage dealers can stay aggressive.
- **Crowd control / debuff:** shuts down dangerous targets or zones so your party takes fewer actions lost.
- **Durable backline-anchor:** sturdier than most casters (shield + medium armour) so you can safely play closer to the action.

### Pros
- Strong party **healing and buffs**
- Excellent **crowd control** options that scale well later
- Great as a **party face** for dialogue and roleplay

### Cons
- Lower raw damage compared to dedicated damage classes
- Many best tools are **concentration-heavy**
- Early game can feel slow until your kit fills out

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **more spell slots + early utility** (your “toolbox” starts expanding)
- Level 3: **College of Valour** (medium armour, shields, martial weapons, upgraded inspiration)
- Level 5: **stronger inspiration + short-rest recovery** (more uptime in long adventuring days)
- Level 6: **Extra Attack** (more flexibility when you need to contribute with weapon turns)
- Level 10: **expertise + major utility growth** (bigger impact in and out of combat)
- Level 12: **Action Surge** (extra action for clutch turns)

---

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** Asmodeus Tiefling
- **Class:** Bard
- **Subclass:** College of Valour (at level 3)
- **Background:** Entertainer
- **Skills:** Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 14 / CON 16 / INT 10 / WIS 10 / CHA 16

### Racial notes (why Asmodeus Tiefling)
- **Fire resistance** for general survivability.
- **A built-in retaliatory option** to punish enemies that hit you.
- **Darkvision** for quality-of-life.

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **Drow** (extra magic utility and improved darkvision).

### Starting setup
- **Armor:** start in light armour, then switch to **medium armour + shield** once your subclass grants proficiency.
- **Weapons:** use whatever early weapons you find; the build trends toward **one-handed + shield** for durability.
- **Role focus:** set up as the **party leader** for dialogue checks (Charisma skills).

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Complete the prologue and **recruit companions**.
- Unlock **Withers** (so you can respec companions to better match the party plan).
- Collect the **Necromancy of Thay** (important later in Act 3).
- Reach the Druid Grove area, sell/stock up, and keep progressing toward **Level 5**.
- Reach the **Underdark / Grymforge** and check **Permanent Bonuses** + **best gear** options in Act 1.

## Level-by-level progression (Bard 1 → 10, Fighter 1 → 2)
> This build is “support tempo” driven. Treat each level’s **Play style** as your default combat loop.

### Level 1 — Bard 1
**Gain**
- **Bardic Inspiration** (bonus action to empower an ally; limited uses until long rest early)
- Cantrips and early spells for **healing, control, and knockback**

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Spend your bonus action empowering allies before or during fights.
- Use your action to **control a key target**, push enemies away, or stabilize an ally with healing.
- Let teammates do most of the damage while you keep the fight manageable.

### Level 2 — Bard 2
**Gain**
- **Jack of All Trades** (adds half proficiency to many checks you aren’t trained in)
- **Song of Rest** (out-of-combat recovery support)
- Access to more level 1 spell slots and the ability to replace spells on level-up

**Play style (Level 2)**
- Loop stays the same: empower allies, control threats, and keep the team healthy.
- Use Song of Rest to reduce the need to return to camp for recovery.

### Level 3 — Bard 3 (College of Valour)
**Subclass**
- **College of Valour**

**Gain**
- **Combat Inspiration** (upgraded inspiration that can boost damage or AC for an attack)
- Proficiency in **medium armour, shields, and martial weapons**
- Access to level 2 spell slots

**Play style (Level 3)**
- Swap into **medium armour + shield** for a big survivability increase.
- Your turn plan becomes: **inspire your best damage dealer**, then lock down or punish the most threatening enemy.
- Use your control tools most when you identify a dangerous frontline enemy or a priority threat.

### Level 4 — Bard 4
**Feat**
- **Ability Improvement: +2 Charisma** (pushes your spell effectiveness and social dominance)

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Your control and support become more reliable; no major loop change.
- Start leaning harder into keeping concentration effects online, since a lot of your value is sustained.

### Level 5 — Bard 5
**Gain**
- **Improved Bardic Inspiration** (bigger inspiration die)
- **Bardic Inspiration refreshes on Short Rest**
- Access to level 3 spell slots

**Play style (Level 5)**
- You have much better **uptime** now: use inspiration more freely.
- Add a reliable **area effect option** for handling groups or setting traps.
- In hard fights, consider using speed/initiative consumables to keep tempo.

### Level 6 — Bard 6
**Gain**
- **Countercharm** (helps allies resist charm/fear effects)
- **Extra Attack** (subclass feature)
- Access to another spell

**Play style (Level 6)**
- You remain primarily support/control, but now you can contribute with weapon turns when spells aren’t ideal.
- Pick **one key control plan** per fight—don’t overload on concentration effects unless necessary.

### Level 7 — Bard 7
**Gain**
- Access to level 4 spell slots

**Play style (Level 7)**
- Your identity becomes “**fight director**”: shut down multiple enemies at once so the party can safely focus targets.
- Maintain concentration and position well—your value scales with staying active.

### Level 8 — Bard 8
**Feat**
- **War Caster** (advantage on concentration saves; helps keep your best effects running)

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Concentration stability is the priority: play near cover, avoid unnecessary hits, and protect your ongoing effects.
- Use your mobility tools to rescue allies and reposition when the frontline collapses.

### Level 9 — Bard 9
**Gain**
- Access to level 5 spell slots

**Play style (Level 9)**
- You become much better at **team stabilization**—big group healing turns can swing entire fights.
- Combine emergency healing with inspiration to prevent teammates from losing their turns.

### Level 10 — Bard 10
**Gain**
- New cantrip
- **Skill Expertise** (the guide recommends **Intimidation** and **Persuasion**)
- **Improved Bardic Inspiration**
- **Magical Secrets** (learn spells from other lists)

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Out of combat, you’re extremely reliable at social checks and exploration utility.
- In combat, you add flexible tools that give you a “second axis” beyond pure Bard control/healing.

### Level 11 — Fighter 1
**Multiclass**
- **Fighter 1** (recommended to avoid a weak top-tier Bard spell selection)

**Gain**
- **Fighting Style: Protection** (shield-focused defensive reaction for nearby allies)

**Play style (Level 11)**
- Stay close enough to allies to protect them, but don’t take unnecessary risks—your value is in keeping the party’s turns online.
- This level is a setup for your endgame “extra action” identity.

### Level 12 — Fighter 2
**Gain**
- **Action Surge** (extra action once per fight; recharges on short rest)

**Play style (Level 12)**
- The build’s endgame clutch button: **extra action** for a second spell, emergency heal + control, or reposition + stabilize.
- Treat Action Surge as your “solve this turn” resource for boss fights and crisis moments.
