## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Warlocks are mysterious and powerful spellcasters who have made a pact with a powerful being, such as a demon, devil, or archfey.
- In exchange for their power, warlocks must serve their patron’s bidding, often in dark and nefarious ways.
- The Archfey subclass features abilities that reflect the power and cunning of the fey.

### Core Playstyle
- Use Eldritch Blast paired with Hex to debuff enemies and deal consistent damage from a distance.
- Leave spell slots for reactions and key utility/area spells, and use short rests to recover spell slots.

### Party Role
- Range DPS
- Crowd Control / Utility
- Summons support (Pact of the Chain, Conjure Elemental)

### Pros
- Eldritch Blast is the most powerful Cantrip in the game and the focus of Warlock Builds.
- Spell slots recharge on short rest.
- Strong survivability tools (Mirror Image, Misty Step, Misty Escape).

### Cons
- Very limited spell slots and aren’t meant to use them like Wizards or Sorcerers.
- Hunger of Hadar requires concentration, so if you’re using Hex, you will not be able to use this ability in conjunction.

### Power Spikes
- Level 2: Agonizing Blast + Repelling Blast
- Level 3: Pact of the Chain (Imp)
- Level 6: Misty Escape + Hunger of Hadar
- Level 7: Book of Ancient Secrets (free spells)
- Level 9: Minions of Chaos (Conjure Elemental)
- Level 11: Mystic Arcanum (Circle of Death)
