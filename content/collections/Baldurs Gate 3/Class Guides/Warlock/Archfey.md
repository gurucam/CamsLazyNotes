## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **ranged control caster**: you command the battlefield with Eldritch Blast, Hex, and crowd control while maintaining distance and summoning allies to fight alongside you.
- Plays like "**stay at range, debuff priority targets, and let your summons handle pressure**"—your damage is consistent and safe, with strong utility spells for versatility.
- You have defensive tools: **Misty Step** for mobility, **Mirror Image** for survivability, and **Misty Escape** to turn invisible when hit.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Hex priority target → Eldritch Blast repeatedly → summon allies → use crowd control and area damage when needed** while staying safe at range with defensive buffs active.

### Party role
- **Ranged damage dealer:** consistent single-target damage with Eldritch Blast + Hex combo.
- **Controller:** crowd control via Sleep, Banishment, Dominate Person, and area denial with Hunger of Hadar.
- **Summoner:** deploy multiple allies (Imp, Elemental, Planar Ally) to absorb pressure and add damage.

### Pros
- Extremely consistent **ranged DPR** with infinite Eldritch Blast
- Strong utility and control options for various encounter types
- Spell slots recharge on **Short Rest** (much more flexible than other casters)
- Can use shield + light armor for excellent survivability

### Cons
- Limited spell slots compared to full casters (compensated by Short Rest recharge)
- Less burst damage than pure damage builds
- Requires positioning awareness to maintain range advantage
- Dependent on Eldritch Invocations for full potential

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Agonizing Blast + Repelling Blast** (Eldritch Blast becomes a powerhouse)
- Level 3: **Pact of the Chain** (summon Imp for additional combatant)
- Level 6: **Misty Escape + Hunger of Hadar** (survivability and area damage)
- Level 9: **Minions of Chaos** (summon Elemental for major battlefield presence)
- Level 11: **Circle of Death** (huge area damage once per Long Rest)

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** High Half-Elf
- **Class:** Warlock
- **Subclass:** The Archfey
- **Background:** Charlatan
- **Skills:** Intimidation, Arcana
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 14 / INT 10 / WIS 10 / CHA 16

### Racial notes (why High Half-Elf)
- **Civil Militia** (shield proficiency—critical for survivability with light armor)
- **Fire Bolt cantrip** (extra ranged damage option)
- **Fey Ancestry** (advantage vs charm, immune to sleep)
- **Darkvision** (quality-of-life, especially in Underdark)

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **Human** (also has Civil Militia for shield proficiency, plus extra skill proficiency and increased carrying capacity).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** Quarterstaff (one-handed) + Shield for maximum AC with light armor.
- **Armor:** Light armor throughout (leverages Dexterity for AC).
- **Ranged backup:** Keep a bow equipped even without proficiency—it still grants +1 initiative from certain gear.
- **Core loop:** Hex as bonus action, then Eldritch Blast repeatedly. Save spell slots for Hellish Rebuke (reaction) and defensive/utility spells.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Complete prologue and recruit companions.
- Unlock Withers to respec companions properly.
- Collect **Necromancy of Thay** in Act 1 (important for Act 3 payoff).
- Progress to level 5 for stronger Eldritch Invocations.
- Reach Underdark/Grymforge to access strong Act 1 gear and check all permanent bonuses.
- Short rest after every fight to maintain spell slot availability.

## Level-by-level progression (Warlock 1 → 12)
> This build is resource-efficient. Treat each level's **Play style** as your combat approach.

### Level 1 — Warlock 1 (The Archfey)
**Gain**
- **Subclass: The Archfey**
- **Fey Presence** (charm or frighten nearby enemies)
- **Cantrips:** Eldritch Blast, Blade Ward
- **Spells:** Hex, Hellish Rebuke
- **Racial cantrip (High Half-Elf):** Fire Bolt
- **Civil Militia** (shield proficiency)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Standard Warlock opening: Hex on priority target (bonus action), then Eldritch Blast repeatedly.
- Use Hellish Rebuke as reaction when hit—set it to "ask" in passives menu to avoid wasting spell slots on low-HP targets.
- Blade Ward for damage reduction when expecting heavy melee pressure.
- You have very few spell slots, so cantrips are your primary damage source.

### Level 2 — Warlock 2
**Gain**
- **Eldritch Invocations:** Agonizing Blast, Repelling Blast
- **Spell:** Sleep
- **Replace Spell** (can swap spells on level-up)
- Extra Warlock spell slot

**Play style (Level 2)**
- **Major damage spike:** Agonizing Blast adds your Charisma modifier to each Eldritch Blast beam.
- Repelling Blast pushes targets 4.5m away—use to control positioning, knock enemies off ledges, or create distance.
- Sleep is powerful early for crowd control (targets up to 24 combined HP)—becomes less useful after level 4.
- Combat loop: Hex → Eldritch Blast with knockback and bonus damage.
- Short rest after fights to maintain spell slots.

### Level 3 — Warlock 3
**Gain**
- **Pact Boon:** Pact of the Chain
- **Spells:** Misty Step, Mirror Image (replace Sleep)
- **Improved Warlock Spells** (higher level spell slots)

**Play style (Level 3)**
- **Summon Imp via Pact of the Chain**—additional combatant that can deal decent damage and absorb pressure.
- Mirror Image is your defensive priority: +9 AC total (3 images × +3 AC each). Cast before taking pressure.
- Misty Step provides emergency mobility—only costs bonus action, so you can still cast spells on the same turn.
- With shield + light armor + Mirror Image, you're very hard to kill.
- Imp summon lasts until Long Rest, so deploy it after resting.

### Level 4 — Warlock 4
**Gain**
- **Feat:** Ability Improvement (+2 Charisma, raising it to 18)
- **Spell:** Shatter

**Play style (Level 4)**
- Higher Charisma improves Eldritch Blast damage and spell save DC.
- Shatter provides area damage with disadvantage against inorganic creatures—use sparingly.
- Continue focusing on Hex + Eldritch Blast as primary damage pattern.
- Working toward Birthright helm in Act 3 (requires 20 Charisma for maximum benefit).

### Level 5 — Warlock 5
**Gain**
- **Deepened Pact** (class feature improves pact effectiveness)
- **Eldritch Invocation:** One with Shadows
- **Spell:** Counterspell

**Play style (Level 5)**
- **One with Shadows:** become invisible in obscured areas (combat and exploration utility).
- Counterspell is crucial defensive tool—nullifies enemy spells level 3 or lower as reaction.
- Save reactions for Counterspell against dangerous enemy casters or Hellish Rebuke for damage.
- Eldritch Blast remains your primary damage source; higher spell slots improve Hex and other utility.

### Level 6 — Warlock 6 (Misty Escape)
**Gain**
- **Subclass feature:** Misty Escape (become invisible when hit; can cast Misty Step next turn)
- **Spell:** Hunger of Hadar

**Play style (Level 6)**
- **Major survivability spike:** Misty Escape gives automatic invisibility + free repositioning when damaged.
- Hunger of Hadar is your first real area damage spell: 2d6 Cold (start of turn) + 2d6 Acid (end of turn), plus difficult terrain and Blind.
- Hunger of Hadar requires concentration, so you can't use it with Hex—choose based on encounter (single target = Hex, grouped enemies = Hunger of Hadar).
- Preparing to leave Act 1: check traders, stock supplies, complete permanent bonuses, and consider Grymforge/Adamantine gear.

### Level 7 — Warlock 7
**Gain**
- **Eldritch Invocation:** Book of Ancient Secrets
- **Spell:** Blight
- **Free spells from Book of Ancient Secrets:** Ray of Sickness, Chromatic Orb, Silence (once per Long Rest each)

**Play style (Level 7)**
- **Massive spell expansion:** Three free spells that don't consume precious Warlock spell slots.
- Chromatic Orb is excellent damage—choose element type based on enemy vulnerabilities (examine enemies in combat).
- Silence shuts down enemy casters in an area (very strong utility).
- Blight provides strong single-target burst damage with disadvantage against plants.
- You now have multiple damage types and utility options without spending spell slots.

### Level 8 — Warlock 8
**Gain**
- **Feat:** Ability Improvement (+2 Charisma, raising it to 20)
- **Spell:** Banishment

**Play style (Level 8)**
- Charisma at 20 maximizes Eldritch Blast damage and spell effectiveness.
- Banishment is powerful single-target crowd control—removes enemy from battlefield for two turns.
- Prioritize acquiring Birthright helm in Act 3 (will push Charisma to 22 with this foundation).
- Continue Hex + Eldritch Blast pattern, using expanded spell list for versatility.

### Level 9 — Warlock 9
**Gain**
- **Eldritch Invocation:** Minions of Chaos (unlocks Conjure Elemental)
- **Spells:** Conjure Elemental, Dominate Person

**Play style (Level 9)**
- **Major power spike:** Summon Elemental (Earth recommended) alongside your Imp and potentially Planar Ally (from gear).
- With three summons active, you have massive battlefield presence—enemies must deal with multiple threats.
- Dominate Person controls humanoid enemies, turning them into temporary allies.
- All summons can be deployed before combat and last until Long Rest.
- Combat becomes: summons engage → Hex priority target → Eldritch Blast safely from range.

### Level 10 — Warlock 10 (Beguiling Defenses)
**Gain**
- **Subclass feature:** Beguiling Defenses (immune to charm; can reflect charm attempts back)
- **Cantrip:** Poison Spray
- **Spell:** Dimension Door

**Play style (Level 10)**
- Charm immunity improves survivability against certain enemies.
- Dimension Door provides teleportation for yourself + one ally—excellent utility for positioning.
- Continue using summons + Hex + Eldritch Blast core loop.
- Poison Spray is situational—Eldritch Blast remains superior damage option.

### Level 11 — Warlock 11
**Gain**
- **Mystic Arcanum** (one level 6 spell free per Long Rest)
- **Free spell:** Circle of Death
- **Spell:** Greater Invisibility

**Play style (Level 11)**
- **Major area damage spike:** Circle of Death devastates grouped enemies (8d6 in massive area, once per Long Rest).
- Circle of Death requires targeting a creature first, then hits area around them—position carefully.
- Greater Invisibility on yourself or ally for extended combat advantage (attacks with advantage, enemies have disadvantage).
- Use Circle of Death on tough multi-enemy fights; save for impactful moments.

### Level 12 — Warlock 12
**Gain**
- **Feat:** Shield Master (requires shield proficiency from race)
- **Eldritch Invocation:** Devil's Sight (see in magical darkness up to 24m)
- **Spell:** Seeming

**Play style (Level 12)**
- Shield Master provides +2 to Dexterity saves and reaction to halve spell damage (no damage on successful save).
- Combined with recommended legendary shield (Viconia's Walking Fortress), survivability is extremely high.
- Devil's Sight synergizes with Darkness/Hunger of Hadar—you can see through it, enemies can't.
- Full endgame combat loop: summons deployed → Mirror Image → Hex → Eldritch Blast from safety → Counterspell/Hellish Rebuke as reactions → area damage/control as needed.
- **Alternative feat if not using shield:** Moderately Armoured (grants medium armor + shield proficiency) or Elemental Affinity (bonus damage for consistent element use).

# Best consumables / items (single-use)
- **Elixir of Bloodlust** — once per turn on kill: **5 temp HP** + **additional action**. Excellent when you can secure kills with Eldritch Blast or your summons can proc it. Chain kills turn into extra actions for more spells or repositioning.
- **Potion of Speed** — extra action, +2 AC, advantage on DEX saves, double movement (3 turns). Allows you to cast two spells in one turn or Eldritch Blast twice. Massive damage spike when combined with Hex. Use for boss fights or tough encounters.
- **Potion of Greater Healing** — 8d4 + 8 healing, removes burning. Keep multiple stocked for emergency recovery when defensive buffs fail. Warlock has limited healing options.
- **Potion of Invisibility** — become invisible for 1 minute (ends on attack/cast). Strong for repositioning, escaping danger, or setting up surprise attacks. Complements Misty Escape for layered defensive options.
- **Potion of Flying** — flying speed for 10 turns. Excellent positioning tool for staying out of melee range while maintaining line of sight for Eldritch Blast. Combine with ranged advantage positioning.
- **Potion of Angelic Slumber** — fall asleep for 2 turns, then restore all spell slots, HP, and abilities. Essentially a Long Rest in combat. Risky but powerful when protected by summons or party. Lets you reuse Mystic Arcanum and refresh everything.
- **Elixir of Peerless Focus** — gain advantage on concentration saves. Critical for maintaining Hex or Hunger of Hadar when under pressure. Craft with Sublimate of Belladonna + any ashes.
- **Elixir of Vigilance** — **+5 initiative**, can't be surprised. Stack with gear bonuses for extremely high initiative. Going first lets you Hex priority targets and establish control before enemies act. Craft with Sublimate of Bloodstained Hook + any ashes.
- **Superior Elixir of Arcane Cultivation** — gain extra level 3 spell slot. Gives you more Counterspells, Hunger of Hadars, or other key spells per rest. Craft with Solution of Night Orchid + any Vitriol.
- **Elixir of Viciousness** — increase critical hit chance. Synergizes with Eldritch Blast volume—more beams = more crit opportunities. Craft with Vitriol of Shadowroot Sac + any ashes.
- **Elixir of Universal Resistance** — gain resistance to all damage. Powerful defensive buff when facing unknown threats or mixed damage types. Craft with Vitriol of Divine Miasma + any Sublimate.

---

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
- **Luck of the Far Realms** — turn a successful hit into a Critical Hit. Excellent with Eldritch Blast—crit a priority target for massive damage. No resource cost once unlocked, just a decision point. Combine with Hex for devastating single-target burst. Best used against high-HP enemies or when you need a guaranteed kill.
- **Cull of the Weak** — when you bring creature below your evolved power count HP, it dies and nearby creatures take 1-4 Psychic damage. Helps clean up weakened enemies and spread chip damage passively. Works well with Eldritch Blast's multi-beam nature—finish targets and proc area damage automatically.
- **Psionic Backlash** — reaction: when enemy within 9m casts spell, inflict 1d4 Psychic damage per spell level. Strong against caster-heavy encounters. Doesn't cost spell slots and works alongside Hellish Rebuke and Counterspell. Passive punishment for enemy casting without requiring your action.
- **Blackhole** — area pull that slows all affected targets. Requires Astral Tadpole in Act 2. Groups scattered enemies for Hunger of Hadar or Circle of Death. Excellent setup tool for area damage. Can be recast for free in some scenarios. Extremely strong for controlling battlefield positioning.
- **Repulsor** — massive area knockback (can hit friendlies). Environmental kill tool—use near ledges, chasms, or hazards for instant kills. Coordinate with party positioning to avoid friendly fire. Combines well with Repelling Blast for layered knockback control.
- **Charm** — force enemy to attack something else. Priority control power for redirecting dangerous enemies away from vulnerable targets. Can break enemy formations or turn their damage against them. No action cost if set as reaction option, but requires tactical awareness.

---

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- **Hexblade Warlock 6 → Paladin 6 (Oath of Vengeance)**
  - Alternative playstyle: melee-focused hybrid instead of pure ranged caster.
  - Start with Hexblade subclass for martial weapon and medium armor proficiency.
  - Take Booming Blade cantrip at level 1 and Shadow Blade spell at level 3.
  - At level 7, multiclass into Oath of Vengeance Paladin for heavy armor and Divine Smite.
  - Combines Shadow Blade psychic damage with Divine Smite burst and Booming Blade's Thunder damage.
  - More complex resource management but creates versatile melee/caster hybrid.
  - Final split: **Hexblade 6 / Paladin 6** for balanced melee and casting.
  - Uses Charisma for both Warlock spells and Paladin features—no ability score conflicts.
  - Trades ranged safety and summon focus for close-range burst damage and heavy armor survivability.

- **Pure Archfey Warlock (1 → 12)**
  - The guide's recommended path for players who want ranged control and summon gameplay.
  - Maximizes Eldritch Invocations, spell slots recharge efficiency, and Archfey subclass features.
  - Stronger late-game with more invocations and higher-level Mystic Arcanum access.
