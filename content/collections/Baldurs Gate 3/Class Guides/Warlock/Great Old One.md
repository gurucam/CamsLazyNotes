## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A **psychic control caster**: you manipulate minds with Eldritch Blast, frighten enemies on crits, and dominate the battlefield through debuffs and mental manipulation.
- Plays like "**control the battlefield, crit to frighten, and overwhelm with summons**"—your damage is consistent at range while you shut down priority targets with fear and crowd control.
- You have strong defensive reactions: **Entropic Ward** imposes disadvantage on attacks against you, and **Hellish Rebuke** punishes attackers automatically.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Hex priority target → Eldritch Blast for crits → trigger Mortal Reminder fear → summon allies → use crowd control and reactions** to dominate encounters while staying safe at range.

### Party role
- **Ranged damage dealer:** consistent single-target damage with Eldritch Blast + Hex combo.
- **Fear specialist:** frighten enemies on critical hits via Mortal Reminder, disrupting enemy actions.
- **Summoner:** deploy multiple allies (Imp, Elemental, Planar Ally) to create battlefield advantage.

### Pros
- Extremely consistent **ranged DPR** with infinite Eldritch Blast
- Unique fear mechanic on crits creates powerful crowd control opportunities
- Spell slots recharge on **Short Rest** (much more resource-efficient than full casters)
- Strong defensive reactions (Entropic Ward, Hellish Rebuke, Counterspell)

### Cons
- Lower raw damage than specialized damage builds
- Fear mechanic requires critical hits to trigger (build invests in crit chance)
- Limited spell slots compared to full casters (compensated by Short Rest recharge)
- Less versatility than Archfey or Fiend in certain situations

### Power spikes to look forward to
- Level 2: **Agonizing Blast + Repelling Blast** (Eldritch Blast becomes powerful)
- Level 4: **Spell Sniper** (increases crit chance for Mortal Reminder procs)
- Level 6: **Entropic Ward + Hunger of Hadar** (defensive boost and area damage)
- Level 9: **Minions of Chaos** (summon Elemental for major battlefield presence)
- Level 11: **Circle of Death** (massive area damage once per Long Rest)

## Character creation
- **Origin:** Custom character
- **Race:** High Half-Elf
- **Class:** Warlock
- **Subclass:** The Great Old One
- **Background:** Charlatan
- **Skills:** Deception, Arcana
- **Abilities (target):** STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 14 / INT 10 / WIS 10 / CHA 16

### Racial notes (why High Half-Elf)

- **Darkvision** (quality-of-life, especially in Underdark)
- **Fey Ancestry** (advantage vs charm, immune to sleep)
- **Extra cantrip** (additional utility or damage option)

*Secondary option mentioned in the guide:* **Human** (also has Civil Militia for shield proficiency, plus extra skill proficiency and increased carrying capacity).

### Starting setup
- **Weapon:** Quarterstaff (one-handed) + Shield for maximum AC with light armor.
- **Armor:** Light armor throughout (leverages Dexterity for AC).
- **Ranged backup:** Keep a bow equipped even without proficiency—certain gear grants +1 initiative regardless.
- **Core loop:** Hex as bonus action, then Eldritch Blast repeatedly. Save spell slots for Hellish Rebuke (reaction) and crowd control.

### Early-game priorities (from the guide)
- Complete prologue and recruit companions.
- Reach Druid Grove and unlock Withers to respec companions properly.
- Progress to level 5 for stronger Eldritch Invocations and additional Eldritch Blast beam.
- Reach Underdark/Grymforge for strong Act 1 gear.
- Short rest after every fight to maintain spell slot availability.
- Build toward critical hit chance to proc Mortal Reminder fear effect.

## Level-by-level progression (Warlock 1 → 12)
> This build focuses on critical hits and fear. Treat each level's **Play style** as your tactical approach.

- **Cantrips:** Eldritch Blast, Blade Ward
- **Spells:** Hex, Hellish Rebuke
- **Racial cantrip (High Half-Elf):** Mage Hand or similar
- **Civil Militia** (shield proficiency)

**Play style (Level 1)**
- Standard Warlock opening: Hex on priority target (bonus action), then Eldritch Blast repeatedly.
- Use Hellish Rebuke as reaction when hit—set it to "ask" in passives menu to avoid wasting spell slots on low-HP targets.
- Blade Ward reduces incoming damage when expecting melee pressure.
- Mortal Reminder won't proc often yet (need crits), but when it does, it frightens multiple enemies.

### Level 2 — Warlock 2
**Gain**

- **Spell:** Tasha's Hideous Laughter
- **Replace Spell** (can swap spells on level-up)
- Extra Warlock spell slot

**Play style (Level 2)**
- **Major damage spike:** Agonizing Blast adds your Charisma modifier to each Eldritch Blast beam.

**Gain**

# Best consumables / items (single-use)
- **Elixir of Bloodlust** — once per turn on kill: **5 temp HP** + **additional action**. Excellent when you can secure kills with Eldritch Blast or your summons proc it. Chain kills into extra actions for more spells, repositioning, or additional Eldritch Blast volleys. Strong for sustained fights where kills are frequent.
- **Potion of Speed** — extra action, +2 AC, advantage on DEX saves, double movement (3 turns). Allows you to cast two spells in one turn or Eldritch Blast twice. Massive damage and fear proc potential when combined with Hex. Use for boss fights or when you need to delete priority targets quickly.
- **Potion of Greater Healing** — 8d4 + 8 healing, removes burning. Stock multiple for emergency recovery. Warlock has limited healing options, so these are critical for survivability when defensive buffs fail or you're caught out of position.
- **Potion of Invisibility** — become invisible for 1 minute (ends on attack/cast). Strong for repositioning before combat, escaping dangerous situations, or setting up advantage on opening attacks. Complements One with Shadows for layered stealth options.
- **Potion of Flying** — flying speed for 10 turns. Excellent positioning tool for staying completely out of melee range while maintaining line of sight for Eldritch Blast. Combine with high ground bonus for additional attack roll advantage.
- **Potion of Angelic Slumber** — fall asleep for 2 turns, then restore all spell slots, HP, and abilities. Essentially a Long Rest in combat. Extremely risky but powerful when protected by summons or party. Lets you reuse Mystic Arcanum (Circle of Death) and refresh everything mid-fight.
- **Elixir of Peerless Focus** — gain advantage on concentration saves. Critical for maintaining Hex or Hunger of Hadar when under pressure. Craft with Sublimate of Belladonna + any ashes. Essential for concentration-heavy encounters.
- **Elixir of Vigilance** — **+5 initiative**, can't be surprised. Stack with gear bonuses for extremely high initiative. Going first lets you Hex priority targets and establish control (or fear via crits) before enemies act. Craft with Sublimate of Bloodstained Hook + any ashes.
- **Superior Elixir of Arcane Cultivation** — gain extra level 3 spell slot. Provides more Counterspells, Hunger of Hadars, or other key spells per rest. Extends your spell slot pool significantly. Craft with Solution of Night Orchid + any Vitriol.
- **Elixir of Viciousness** — increase critical hit chance. Directly synergizes with Mortal Reminder—more crits = more fear procs. Stack with Spell Sniper and Killer's Sweetheart for consistent crits. Craft with Vitriol of Shadowroot Sac + any ashes.
- **Elixir of Universal Resistance** — gain resistance to all damage. Powerful defensive buff when facing unknown threats or mixed damage types. Helps you stay in range for Eldritch Blast without worry. Craft with Vitriol of Divine Miasma + any Sublimate.

---

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
- **Luck of the Far Realms** — turn a successful hit into a Critical Hit. Perfect for this build: guaranteed crit on Eldritch Blast = guaranteed Mortal Reminder proc = multiple enemies frightened. No resource cost once unlocked. Combine with Hex for massive burst and area fear. Best used against grouped enemies or when you need guaranteed fear on high-priority targets.
- **Cull of the Weak** — when you bring creature below your evolved power count HP, it dies and nearby creatures take 1-4 Psychic damage. Helps execute low-HP enemies and spread chip damage passively. Works well with Eldritch Blast's multi-beam nature and summon attacks—finish targets automatically and damage nearby foes.
- **Psionic Backlash** — reaction: when enemy within 9m casts spell, inflict 1d4 Psychic damage per spell level. Strong against caster-heavy encounters. Stacks with Thought Shield: Psychic Reflection for layered psychic punishment. Works alongside Hellish Rebuke and Counterspell—doesn't cost spell slots.
- **Blackhole** — area pull that slows all affected targets. Requires Astral Tadpole in Act 2. Groups scattered enemies for Hunger of Hadar, Circle of Death, or Evard's Black Tentacles. Excellent battlefield control. Can be recast for free in some scenarios. Pulls enemies into summon range for coordinated strikes.
- **Repulsor** — massive area knockback (can hit friendlies). Environmental kill tool—use near ledges, chasms, or hazards for instant kills on multiple enemies. Coordinate with party positioning to avoid friendly fire. Combines with Repelling Blast Eldritch Invocation for layered knockback control and positioning dominance.
- **Charm** — force enemy to attack something else. Priority control power for redirecting dangerous enemies away from vulnerable targets or yourself. Can turn enemy damage against their own allies. No action cost if set as reaction, but requires tactical awareness. Strong for breaking enemy focus on summons or party members.

---

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- **Hexblade Warlock 6 → Paladin 6 (Oath of Vengeance)**
  - Alternative playstyle: melee-focused hybrid instead of ranged fear specialist.
  - Start with Hexblade subclass for martial weapon and medium armor proficiency.
  - Take Booming Blade cantrip at level 1 and Shadow Blade spell at level 3.
  - At level 7, multiclass into Oath of Vengeance Paladin for heavy armor and Divine Smite.
  - Combines Shadow Blade psychic damage with Divine Smite burst and Booming Blade's Thunder damage.
  - More complex resource management but creates versatile melee/caster hybrid.
  - Final split: **Hexblade 6 / Paladin 6** for balanced melee and casting.
  - Uses Charisma for both Warlock spells and Paladin features—no ability score conflicts.
  - Trades ranged safety, fear procs, and summon focus for close-range burst damage and heavy armor survivability.

- **Pure Great Old One Warlock (1 → 12)**
  - The guide's recommended path for players who want fear-focused ranged control and summons.
  - Maximizes critical hit chance with Spell Sniper + Killer's Sweetheart + Elixir of Viciousness for consistent Mortal Reminder procs.
  - Stronger late-game with more Eldritch Invocations and higher-level Mystic Arcanum access.
  - Focus on stacking defensive reactions (Entropic Ward, Hellish Rebuke, Counterspell, Thought Shield) to punish attackers.
