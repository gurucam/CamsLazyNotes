## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- A powerful **hybrid spellcaster** who excels in melee combat using Charisma for both attacks and spellcasting.
- Focuses on the **Pact Weapon** feature to turn any weapon into a Charisma-scaling implement of destruction, refreshing short-rest spell slots frequently.
- Plays like a **frontline duelist** capable of high single-target burst and powerful area control spells.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- Apply the **Hexblade’s Curse** to a primary target, then use your Charisma-driven melee attacks (Pact Weapon) combined with powerful, short-rest spell slots for immediate, heavy single-target damage and quick takedowns.

### Party role
- **Frontline striker** and **Short Rest focused blaster:** Excels at deleting a single high-priority target while maintaining strong damage output with cantrips and high-impact control spells.

### Key stats
- **Charisma (CHA)**: Primary ability score for Attack Rolls, Damage Rolls (with Pact Weapon), and Spell Save DC.
- **Constitution (CON)**: Important for hit points and maintaining Concentration on key spells like *Hex*.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Secondary stat for Armour Class (AC) and Initiative.

### Best Race
- **Half-Elf**: Provides Shield Proficiency, which is crucial for early survivability.
- **Githyanki**: Excellent option for immediate Greatsword Proficiency and access to powerful racial spells.

### Recommended Background
- **Guild Artisan** (Insight, Persuasion) or **Soldier** (Athletics, Intimidation).

## Character creation

### Starting class and proficiencies

### Starting ability scores
- **CHA:** 17
- **CON:** 16
- **DEX:** 14
- **STR:** 8
- **INT:** 8
- **WIS:** 10

## Level-by-level progression (Warlock 1 → 12)

#### Level 1
##### GAIN
- Class features, Subclass: Hexblade.
- Hex Warrior (use CHA for attack/damage rolls on one weapon).
- Spell Slots, Spells (e.g., *Hex*, *Eldritch Blast*).

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 1)
- You are primarily a ranged caster at this level, relying on **Eldritch Blast** as your go-to damage source.
- Use **Hex** on the toughest enemy in major fights to gain extra damage on every hit from your *Eldritch Blast*.
- Your resources are very limited, so use your two short-rest spell slots strategically for the most threatening encounters.

#### Level 2
##### GAIN
- 2 Eldritch Invocations (Agonizing Blast, Devil's Sight).
- Spell Slots.

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 2)
- **Agonizing Blast** is a massive boost, adding your CHA modifier to the damage of *Eldritch Blast*, making it one of the best cantrips in the game.
- Use **Devil's Sight** to gain Advantage on attack rolls if you or an ally can create a cloud of *Darkness*.
- The core loop is still *Eldritch Blast*, but now it hits significantly harder.

#### Level 3
##### GAIN
- Pact Boon (Pact of the Blade).
- Level 2 Spell Slots.
- Spell (e.g., *Misty Step*, *Darkness*).

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 3)
- You are now a true Hexblade melee warrior. Use your Action to make your chosen two-handed weapon a **Pact Weapon**, which now scales its attack and damage rolls with your Charisma.
- Your combat rotation is simple: Open with your **Hexblade’s Curse** on the primary target, then move into melee and strike with your Pact Weapon.
- Save *Misty Step* for emergencies to reposition or escape dangerous areas.

#### Level 4
##### GAIN
- Feat (Great Weapon Master).
- Spell.

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 4)
- This is your first major damage spike. Toggle on the **Great Weapon Master** passive for -5 to Attack Rolls but +10 to Damage.
- You must find ways to gain Advantage (e.g., from *Darkness* or other build effects) to offset the attack penalty.
- Prioritize killing low-health enemies to gain the **Great Weapon Master** bonus action attack, significantly boosting your damage rotation.

#### Level 5
##### GAIN
- 3rd Level Spell Slots.
- Eldritch Invocation (Thirsting Blade).
- Spell (e.g., *Hunger of Hadar*).

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 5)
- **Thirsting Blade** grants you **Extra Attack** with your Pact Weapon, doubling your base melee damage and making you a true martial threat.
- Your rotation stabilizes: Curse → two melee attacks. Use your spell slots for powerful 3rd level control spells like **Hunger of Hadar** for area denial.
- Remember to short rest after every encounter to replenish your two 3rd level slots.

#### Level 6
##### GAIN
- Hexblade feature (Accursed Specter).
- Spell.

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 6)
- The **Accursed Specter** feature allows you to summon a temporary ally after defeating a humanoid. Use this to your advantage in fights against multiple humanoids for extra actions.
- Continue the core melee rotation. Your power is now consistent and potent due to the two Charisma-based attacks.

#### Level 7
##### GAIN
- 4th Level Spell Slots.
- Eldritch Invocation (e.g., Tome of Ancient Secrets or similar utility).
- Spell.

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 7)
- Access to 4th Level spells means powerful control options like **Banishment** are available to neutralize the most dangerous enemy on the field.
- When faced with two major threats, use **Banishment** on one and focus your full melee power on the other.

#### Level 8
##### GAIN
- Feat (Ability Score Improvement: +2 CHA).
- Spell.

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 8)
- Use the **Ability Score Improvement** to cap your **Charisma at 20**.
- This improves your chance to hit, your spell DC, and the damage bonus from *Agonizing Blast* and your Pact Weapon. Your attacks should now rarely miss.

#### Level 9
##### GAIN
- 5th Level Spell Slots.
- Spell (e.g., *Synaptic Static*).

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 9)
- **Synaptic Static** is a game-changing 5th-level spell. It deals massive Psychic damage in an area and applies a concentration-free debuff that gives enemies Disadvantage on attack rolls.
- Use this spell at the start of difficult encounters to both deal burst damage and significantly reduce enemy threat.

#### Level 10
##### GAIN
- Eldritch Invocation (Ghostly Gaze/Repelling Blast or similar utility).
- Hexblade feature (Armor of Hexes).
- Spell.

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 10)
- The **Armor of Hexes** feature is a strong defensive boost: the target of your Hexblade’s Curse now has Disadvantage on Attack Rolls against you.
- You can now confidently focus on the highest damage dealer in melee, knowing you are extremely difficult for them to hit.

#### Level 11
##### GAIN
- Mystic Arcanum (6th Level Spell: e.g., *Circle of Death*).
- Eldritch Master.

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 11)
- **Mystic Arcanum** provides a powerful, once-per-Long Rest 6th level spell (like **Circle of Death**) for use in boss fights.
- **Eldritch Master** allows you to fully restore your spell slots once per Long Rest, greatly increasing your sustainability in a dungeon crawl.

#### Level 12
##### GAIN
- Feat (Eldritch Invocation: Lifedrinker, or Ability Score Improvement: +2 CON or Resilient: CON).
- Eldritch Invocation (Lifedrinker).

##### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 12)
- The final damage spike is **Lifedrinker**, which adds your CHA modifier as Necrotic damage to your melee attacks.
- Your final melee attack damage is now exceptionally high, scaling with the Great Weapon Master toggle, *Hex*, and your tripled CHA modifier (Pact Weapon damage, GWM, Lifedrinker).
- If you took the Feat, use it to boost your CON to 22 or 24 (with Amulet) for massive health and concentration stability.

## Best consumables / items (single-use)
Consumables are essential for difficult encounters, allowing you to maximize your limited high-level resources.

- **Elixir of Bloodlust** — *Grants a powerful resource refresh on enemy kill.*
  - **What it does:** Once per turn on a kill, gain 5 temporary HP and an additional action.
  - **Why it's strong:** The Hexblade focuses on maximizing attacks and generating burst turns; this grants an extra action, allowing you to attack three times, reposition, or cast a control spell.
  - **When to use:** Use in any combat where you anticipate multiple kills, especially against groups of weaker enemies preceding a boss.

- **Potion of Speed** — *The single best consumable for burst damage.*
  - **What it does:** Grants an extra action, +2 AC, advantage on Dexterity saves, and doubles movement for the turn.
  - **Why it's strong:** Combining this with the Pact Weapon's Extra Attack gives you four main weapon attacks (or two attacks + a high-level spell) in a single turn.
  - **When to use:** Reserve for boss fights, major area clearing, or when you absolutely must defeat a target in a single turn.

- **Elixir of Hill Giant Strength** — *A strong option if you are a Githyanki or want maximum Titanstring Bow damage.*
  - **What it does:** Sets your Strength score to **21** (until Long Rest).
  - **Why it's strong:** While your melee attack rolls use CHA, this allows you to benefit fully from the *Titanstring Bow* (if used) and helps with Athletics checks/jumps.
  - **When to use:** Useful if you need to carry heavy gear, or if your build is using a weapon that still relies on Strength for its attack roll (before Pact Weapon is active or for utility).

- **Oil of Accuracy** — *Increases your chance to hit when you need it most.*
  - **What it does:** Weapon coating that grants a permanent **+2 Attack Rolls** until your next Long Rest.
  - **Why it's strong:** Stacks with Advantage and helps offset the -5 Attack Roll penalty from **Great Weapon Master** (GWM).
  - **When to use:** Apply at the start of a difficult area or before entering a high-stakes fight where every attack needs to land.

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)
The Hexblade benefits significantly from tadpole powers that offer critical hit boosts, resource-free crowd control, or immediate defensive reactions.

- **Luck of the Far Realms** — *Transforms damage into assured critical hits.*
  - **What it does:** Allows you to use a reaction to turn any successful attack roll into a Critical Hit.
  - **Why it synergizes:** As a GWM Hexblade, your entire build focuses on landing high-damage critical hits and attacks. Using this on a crucial final attack roll for a GWM kill ensures the enemy is deleted, often triggering a GWM bonus action attack.

- **Cull of the Weak** — *A free source of reliable area damage.*
  - **What it does:** Executes low-HP enemies upon a successful attack; nearby creatures take Psychic damage.
  - **Why it synergizes:** You deal massive single-target damage with your Pact Weapon. This ensures that you don't waste damage on targets near death, and the resulting chain damage helps clear clustered enemies.

- **Psionic Backlash** — *Resource-free reaction defense.*
  - **What it does:** Deals Psychic damage to an enemy when they cast a spell against you.
  - **Why it synergizes:** Provides a powerful, reliable reaction option that Warlocks generally lack, punishing enemy spellcasters for targeting you.

- **Blackhole** — *Massive, concentration-free area control.*
  - **What it does:** Pulls all creatures into a central point and slows them.
  - **Why it synergizes:** Allows you to set up devastating area-of-effect spells (*Hunger of Hadar*, *Synaptic Static*) or simply gather enemies for a massive cleave attack.

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- **Warlock (10) / Fighter (2)**
  - This route sacrifices the final Feat and the *Lifedrinker* Invocation (Level 12 Warlock features).
  - **GAIN:** Action Surge (an extra full action once per Short Rest) and the Great Weapon Fighting Style.
  - **Why it's good:** The burst potential is higher due to Action Surge, which can be used alongside a Potion of Speed for an unprecedented number of attacks in a single turn. The **Great Weapon Fighting** style also slightly increases damage consistency.
