## Character Creation
- Race: Half-Orc
- Class: Warlock
- Subclass: Hexblade
- Background: Entertainer
- Ability Scores: STR 8 / DEX 16 / CON 14 / INT 8 / WIS 10 / CHA 17
- Proficiencies: Deception, Investigation

## Level Progression

### Level 1
- Gain:
  - Subclass: Hexblade
  - Cantrips: Eldritch Blast, Booming Blade
  - Spells: Hex, Wrathful Smite
  - Hex Warrior: Proficiency with Medium armour, Shields, and Martial weapons; gain Bind Hexed Weapon (use Charisma modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity when attacking with proficient weapons).
  - Bind Hexed Weapon: Bind to your main hand weapon (damage becomes magical; cannot drop or throw; become Proficient if you weren’t; chance to apply Hexblade’s Curse on attack).
  - Hexblade’s Curse: Curse a target (damage rolls gain bonus equal to target’s Proficiency bonus; Critical Hit number reduced by 1; if target dies, regain hit points equal to Warlock level + Charisma modifier).
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Hex / Eldritch Blast for ranged damage, or Booming Blade for melee.
    - Turn 2+: Continue Hex + Eldritch Blast at range; Booming Blade is the go-to melee attack.
  - Notes:
    - Booming Blade: Strike with your weapon, afflicting your foe with a resonance that hurts them for 1d8 Thunder when they move.
    - Use Wrathful Smite for all-out burst damage; at level 3 you gain access to Shadow Blade (main weapon).

### Level 2
- Gain:
  - Spell: Hellish Rebuke (recommended)
  - Spell: Shield (recommended to keep a slot in reserve)
  - Eldritch Invocations: Devil’s Sight, One with Shadows
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Maintain a spell slot in reserve for Shield; short rest after every fight if you can.
    - Turn 2+: Use Devil’s Sight + Darkness combo when available (see notes).
  - Notes:
    - Hellish Rebuke: React to your next attacker with flames that deal 2d10 Fire damage.
    - Devil’s Sight: See normally in darkness (magical and non-magical) to 24 meters.
    - One with Shadows: Vanish into the darkness and become Invisible, as long as you stand still.
    - Devil’s Sight trick: cast the Darkness spell on top of yourself and still see through it; enemies will almost always miss you but you can attack while inside (use a Wizard or select the spell to use this combo).

### Level 3
- Gain:
  - Spell: Shadow Blade (recommended)
  - Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain
  - Hexblade always-prepared spells (noted in subclass list): Blur, Branding Smite (Expanded Spell List Level 3)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Summon Shadow Blade (bonus action) and attack in melee.
    - Turn 2+: Continue melee attacks with Shadow Blade as main damage source.
  - Notes:
    - Shadow Blade: Creates a shadowy shortsword in your hand that deals 2d8 Psychic damage; becomes the main source of damage.
    - If using a physical weapon, bind it so it scales off Charisma (use this approach rather than Shadow Blade if using a two handed weapon).
    - Advantage of Shadow Blade: summon in main hand, not worry about any weapon the rest of the game, and use a shield.
    - SUPER IMPORTANT: Act 2 has the Resonance Stone which doubles psychic damage (it “literally doubles Shadow Blade”). Do not miss this at the end of Act 2.
    - Pact of the Chain usage: better because you already have Bind Hexed Weapon; Pact of the Tome is helpful if you take Warlock high levels to gain more spells.

### Level 4
- Gain:
  - Cantrip: Mage Hand
  - Spell: Darkness
  - Feat: Ability Improvement (Charisma +2)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Darkness to heavily obscure/blind and restrict ranged attacks into/out of it; leverage Devil’s Sight synergy when applicable.
    - Turn 2+: Continue melee with Shadow Blade or bound weapon while using Darkness as a protective bubble.
  - Notes:
    - Make sure to get another +1 Charisma with Auntie Ethel Hair permanent bonus in southwest part of map.

### Level 5
- Gain:
  - Spell: Counterspell
  - Eldritch Invocation: Repelling Blast
  - Subclass: Extra Attack (Deepened Pact noted as “Gain an Extra Attack with your pact weapon.”)
  - Hexblade always-prepared spells (noted in subclass list): Blink, Elemental Weapon (Expanded Spell List Level 5)
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Counterspell to stop a spell from being cast when needed.
    - Turn 2+: Repelling Blast can push targets up to 4.5 meters when hit by Eldritch Blast.
  - Notes:
    - Extra Attack will work on your bound pact weapon; it may not work on Shadow Blade, but when you multiclass to Paladin extra attack will work.

### Level 6
- Gain:
  - Subclass feature: Accursed Spectre
  - Spell: Misty Step
  - Spell change: Drop Hellish Rebuke and pick up Hunger of Hadar
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Place Darkness-type spells (e.g., Hunger of Hadar) and move into them to gain advantage with Shadow Blade while obscured.
    - Turn 2+: Use Misty Step for repositioning; continue melee attacks.
  - Notes:
    - Accursed Spectre: Raise an Accursed Spectre from the soul of a fallen cursed target; size determines Feeble / Mundane / Primordial Spectre.
    - Hunger of Hadar: Conceals you and works with Devil’s Sight; while in Darkness or Obscured, Shadow Blade will have advantage.

### Level 7
- Gain:
  - Multiclass into Paladin
  - Subclass: Oath of Vengeance
  - Paladin features: Channeled Oath Charges, Lay on Hands, Divine Sense, Inquisitor’s Might
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Use Inquisitor’s Might (bonus action) when you want bonus action utility.
    - Turn 2+: Stack the damage of Divine Smite with Shadow Blade (reason for Paladin multiclass is stated as stacking Divine Smite with Shadow Blade).

    - Divine Favor
    - Shield of Faith
    - Protection from Good and Evil
- Play Style:
  - Rotation:
    - Turn 1: Save spell slots for Divine Smite and use on melee attacks.
    - Turn 2+: Use Shield of Faith prior to fights where you expect to take the majority of the damage.
  - Notes:
    - Shield of Faith: bonus action; requires concentration; increases Armour Class by 2.
    - Protection from Good and Evil: protect an ally against the attacks and powers of Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead.

### Level 9
- Gain:

    - Turn 1: Use Alert to attack earlier (noted as “highly effective to get you to attack earlier”).
    - Turn 2+: Continue Shadow Blade melee plan.
  - Notes:

  - Hexblade’s Curse targets after Shadow Blade is summoned for extra damage.
  - Boost overall Charisma to increase damage of spells and melee attacks.
- General tips listed:
  - Loot Everything: You will need a lot of gold to buy consumables, potions, and ammunition so loot and sell constantly.
  - Crafting: Elixirs and potions are vital, and you need to purchase materials when trading for crafting.
  - Reach Level 6: Spend the early part of the game completing every quest to reach level 6 where your power dramatically increases.
  - Sell Often: Your carrying capacity will be limited so sell often, and store excessive items in your traveler’s chest.
  - Stealth: Start combat in stealth if at all possible to trigger the Surprise status effect.
  - Consider Illithid Powers: While it can come with an altered appearance, the powers are powerful and can help you.
  - Oils + Elixiris: Combine both oils/coatings and elixirs during combat for a dual benefit.
  - Persuasion: Try to avoid combat through dialogue if possible.
- Best tip called out:
  - Take Devil’s Sight and combo it with Darkness for a protective bubble that will allow you to attack inside.
  - Pair Shadow Blade with the Resonance Stone to double your melee damage.

## Alternative Build Route
- Hexblade Level 1 dip:
  - Shields, Medium Armour, Martial Weapons, Bind Hexed Weapon, Hexblade Curse.
  - Lets you bind your weapon (two-handed typically) and use Charisma as your damage dealing stat rather than Strength or Dexterity.
  - Noted as a level 1 dip for every Charisma build (Bard, Paladin, Sorcerer).
- Hexblade Level 2 dip:
  - Eldritch Invocations: Devil’s Sight and One With Shadows.
  - Devil’s Sight: cast Darkness on top of yourself and still see through it; helpful with Shadow Blade giving you advantage while obscured.
  - One with Shadows: stealth while not moving in dark areas.
- Hexblade + Sorcerer:
  - Advantage of a 1 Hexblade dip is bonus action utility (Hexblade Curse) and Bind Hexed Weapon; you can use the Sorc as a melee and medium armour user.
- Hexblade + Paladin:
  - Pick up Paladin if you want Divine Smites; massive burst damage with Paladin’s spell slots.
- Hexblade + Bard:
  - Useful for more utility with Bardic Inspiration.

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- Introduced the long-awaited Hexblade subclass and the Booming Blade cantrip.
- The guide notes a “major evolution” for Warlock with a seamless fusion of spellcasting and melee combat, enabling Warlocks to dominate in close-quarters fights while keeping Charisma as the core stat.
- Patch 8 impact highlighted: Hexblade sub-class, Booming Blade cantrip, and Shadow Blade spell combine to form a powerful pure melee build that also has wide spell applications.
