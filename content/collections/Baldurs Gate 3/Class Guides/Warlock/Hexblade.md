## Build Snapshot

### Fantasy / Flavor
- Great Old One Warlocks “summon otherworldly powers from the Far Realms” and can “establish telepathic connections with their adversaries.”
- Inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft with “psychic powers, telepathy, and mental manipulation skills.”

### Core Playstyle
- “Hex and Eldritch Blast repeatedly.”
- Leave spell slots for reaction and control tools; “Warlocks regain their spell slots on short rest.”

### Party Role

### Pros

- Simplicity Cantrip Caster

- Level 6: Hunger of Hadar and Entropic Ward (subclass feature).
