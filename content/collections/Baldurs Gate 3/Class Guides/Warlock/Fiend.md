## Gameplay Tips and Tricks
1. Eldritch Blast: Eldritch Blast is your bread-and-butter cantrip and should be cast in conjunction with Hex which is a bonus action for optimal damage.
2. Short Rests: Utilize short rests to recover spell slots and replenish your resources, as Warlocks regain their spell slots on short rest.
3. Ranged Advantage: As a ranged spellcaster, maintain distance from enemies to reduce the likelihood of taking damage.
4. High Ground: When you attack from above, you gain a +2 bonus to the Attack Roll so always look to go up!
5. Crowd Control: Use spells like “Hold Person” and “Hypnotic Pattern” to control groups of enemies and turn the tide of battles or have companions cast similar spells.
6. Avoiding Friendly Fire: Be cautious with area-of-effect spells to avoid hitting your own party members.
7. Use Consumables: Potion of Speed gives you an additional action and can be found during the tutorial.
8. Misty Step: save a level 2 spell in case you need to retreat via Misty Step.
9. Spell Slots: Save spell slots for Hellish Rebuke which reacts when taking damage without costing an action.
10. Mirror Image: Cast this immediately when taking melee pressure for survivability.

## Alternative Build Route
For this alternative Warlock build, you’ll start with the Hexblade subclass, which immediately grants enhanced weapon and armor proficiencies. Perfect for a more combat-oriented playstyle. It’s noted that all Warlocks can still pick up the Booming Blade cantrip at Level 1 and unlock Shadow Blade by Level 3, and “sticking with The Fiend subclass remains a viable option if you prefer its unique spell and survivability bonuses.”

At Level 7, the build shifts toward a multiclass with Oath of Vengeance Paladin. This progression “dramatically improves your frontline capabilities by granting Heavy Armor proficiency and stronger melee performance.” Note: “to benefit from Booming Blade’s bonus damage, you must use a weapon you’re proficient with. Otherwise, the cantrip’s additional Thunder damage won’t trigger.”

Level | Class | Selection
--- | --- | ---
1 | Warlock | Subclass: Hexblade, Eldritch Blast, Booming Blade, Hex, Wrathful Smite
2 | Warlock | Hellish Rebuke, Eldritch Invocations: Devil’s Sight and One with Shadows
3 | Warlock | Shadow Blade, Pact Boon: Pact of the Chain
4 | Warlock | Mage Hand, Darkness, Feat: Ability Improvement Charisma +2
5 | Warlock | Counterspell, Eldritch Invocations: Repelling Blast
6 | Warlock | Misty Step
7 | Paladin | Subclass: Oath of Vengeance, Armor/Weapon Proficiencies
8 | Paladin | Defence Fighting Style, Command, Thunderous Smite, Divine Favour, Searing Smite, Shield, Cure Wounds
9 | Paladin | Protection from Good and Evil
10 | Paladin | Compelled Duel, Feat: Alert
11 | Paladin | Magic Weapon
12 | Paladin | Protection from Poison

## Patch Changes

### Patch 8
- “With Patch 8 of Baldur’s Gate 3, the Warlock class received a major boost thanks to the introduction of the Hexblade subclass and the Booming Blade cantrip.”
