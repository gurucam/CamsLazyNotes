## Build snapshot

### Fantasy / flavor
- The Warlock uses a Cantrip for its primary damage source and has light armour proficiency.
- They are simplistic spellcasters and play like a hybrid based on the subclass and choices during the leveling process.
- The Fiend subclass provides a unique bonus when killing enemies, making it a highly survivable subclass in combat.

### Core playstyle in one sentence
- **Use your potent Cantrip** (*Eldritch Blast*) as your main source of damage while leveraging the Fiend's gift to gain temporary hit points for high survivability after defeating enemies.

### Party role
- **Cantrip-Focused Damage Dealer:** High sustained single-target damage with *Eldritch Blast*.
- **Tanky Caster/Survivability:** Due to Dark One's Blessing, they are difficult to kill, acting as a sturdy mid-line caster.

## Level-by-level progression (Warlock 1 → 12)

### Level 1

#### GAIN
- Class: Warlock, Subclass: **Fiend**
- Subclass Feature: **Dark One's Blessing**
- Cantrips (2), Spells (2), Spell Slots (1st level)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 1)
- **Prioritize:** Getting a kill or dealing high damage with the *Eldritch Blast* Cantrip.
- **Resource Spending:** Use your few spell slots for high-impact single-target removal or utility. Immediately focus on securing kills to gain Temporary HP from **Dark One's Blessing**.
- **Typical Turn:** Cast *Eldritch Blast* every turn to deal damage and maintain battlefield presence.

### Level 2

#### GAIN
- Feature: **Eldritch Invocations** (2 choices)
- Spell Slots (1st level)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 2)
- **Prioritize:** Selecting **Agonizing Blast** to add your Charisma modifier to *Eldritch Blast* damage—this is the core of the build's power spike.
- **Resource Spending:** Select **Repelling Blast** to push enemies away, giving you safe distance or pushing them into environmental hazards.
- **Typical Turn:** Focus on using *Eldritch Blast* to both damage and control the distance between you and enemies.

### Level 3

#### GAIN
- Feature: **Pact Boon** (Pact of the Blade)
- Spell Slots (2nd level)
- Spells: Level 2 spells unlocked (*Misty Step* or *Hold Person*)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 3)
- **Prioritize:** Using new 2nd level spells like *Misty Step* for superior mobility and positioning, or *Hold Person* for single-target lockdown.
- **Resource Spending:** Use your 2nd level slots wisely, as you still only have two slots per Short Rest. **Pact of the Blade** offers utility but doesn't change the Cantrip-focused casting rotation.
- **Typical Turn:** Maintain Cantrip rotation, using a powerful 2nd-level spell to remove a threat or secure a critical kill to gain Temporary HP.

### Level 4

#### GAIN
- Feat: **Ability Improvement** (ASI)
- New Cantrip and Spell

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 4)
- **Prioritize:** Taking **Ability Improvement** to raise CHA, which is critical for maximizing *Eldritch Blast* damage and increasing your spell save DC.
- **Resource Spending:** Your spells are now significantly harder to resist. Continue the Cantrip rotation, ensuring your main damage source hits reliably.
- **Typical Turn:** Full offense with *Eldritch Blast*, using leveled spells only when the high-DC save is necessary to disable a powerful enemy.

### Level 5

#### GAIN
- Feature: **Deepened Pact**
- Spell Slots (3rd level)
- Spells: Level 3 spells unlocked (*Fireball* or *Hypnotic Pattern*)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 5)
- **Prioritize:** Massive power spike: *Eldritch Blast* now fires two beams, effectively doubling your Cantrip damage.
- **Resource Spending:** Use Level 3 spell slots for powerful AoE spells like *Fireball* or encounter-ending control spells like *Hypnotic Pattern*.
- **Typical Turn:** Open with a leveled spell against a group, then use the now-doubled *Eldritch Blast* to clean up remaining targets.

### Level 6

#### GAIN
- Subclass Feature: **Dark One's Own Luck**
- New Spell

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 6)
- **Prioritize:** **Dark One's Own Luck** is a powerful defensive tool. Use your reaction to add a d10 to a failed Ability Check or Saving Throw once per Short/Long Rest.
- **Resource Spending:** Use this reaction to avoid critical enemy effects (like *Hold Person*) or secure key dialogue checks. This feature increases your overall reliability significantly.
- **Typical Turn:** Maintain normal attack rotation, but be ready to use your reaction to save yourself from a debilitating condition.

### Level 7

#### GAIN
- Eldritch Invocations (3rd choice)
- Spell Slots (4th level)
- Spells: Level 4 spells unlocked (*Banishment* or *Dimension Door*)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 7)
- **Prioritize:** New 4th level slots allow for powerful control spells like *Banishment* to temporarily remove the highest-threat enemy from combat.
- **Resource Spending:** Focus your limited high-level slots on removing or disabling key threats. Select a new Invocation, focusing on passive utility or extra Cantrips.
- **Typical Turn:** If facing a boss, use *Banishment* to temporarily turn the fight into a 4v3, then use *Eldritch Blast* to clear minions.

### Level 8

#### GAIN
- Feat: **Ability Improvement** (ASI)
- New Spell

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 8)
- **Prioritize:** Maxing out **Charisma** to 20 with the final Ability Improvement. This is the absolute final boost to *Eldritch Blast* damage and spell DC.
- **Resource Spending:** All your abilities are now maximized in power. Continue leveraging the high CHA for powerful, high-DC spell saves and Cantrip damage.
- **Typical Turn:** Full offense with maxed Cantrip damage, ensuring every kill grants maximum Temporary HP.

### Level 9

#### GAIN
- Spell Slots (5th level)
- Spells: Level 5 spells unlocked (*Synaptic Static* or *Cone of Cold*)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 9)
- **Prioritize:** Using new 5th level spells like *Synaptic Static* for massive AoE damage and control.
- **Resource Spending:** Level 5 slots should be reserved for encounters that need to end quickly with high burst damage. *Eldritch Blast* is still your primary action every turn.
- **Typical Turn:** Use a Level 5 spell to hit as many targets as possible, then use *Eldritch Blast* for reliable follow-up damage.

### Level 10

#### GAIN
- Subclass Feature: **Fiendish Resilience**
- New Cantrip and Spell

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 10)
- **Prioritize:** **Fiendish Resilience** allows you to select a damage type (Slashing, Fire, Cold, etc.) to gain resistance to until your next Long Rest.
- **Resource Spending:** Before entering a dangerous area, select the most common damage type you expect to face (e.g., Fire in a volcano area) for a huge defensive boost. This makes you extremely durable.
- **Typical Turn:** Enjoy the defensive bonus while focusing on maintaining maximum damage output with *Eldritch Blast*.

### Level 11

#### GAIN
- Feature: **Mystic Arcanum** (Level 6 Spell)
- Spell Slots (5th level, 3 total)

- **Prioritize:** Biggest Cantrip spike: *Eldritch Blast* now fires three beams, maximizing your Cantrip damage.
- **Resource Spending:** You gain a single Level 6 spell (Mystic Arcanum) like *Chain Lightning* or *Circle of Death*. Reserve this for the most difficult fights when a massive AoE is required.
- **Typical Turn:** Use *Eldritch Blast* for three separate attacks, often focusing on a single target for massive damage.

### Level 12

#### GAIN
- Feat: **Elemental Adept** (Fire or Lightning)
- Eldritch Invocations (4th choice)

#### PLAY STYLE (LEVEL 12)
- **Prioritize:** The **Elemental Adept** feat ensures your spells cannot be resisted by enemies and guarantees a minimum damage roll. Choose the element you use most often (e.g., Fire for *Fireball*).
- **Resource Spending:** With the ultimate damage Cantrip (*Eldritch Blast*) and reliable high-level spells, you are fully online. Use your new Invocation for passive utility.
- **Typical Turn:** Focus on blasting with *Eldritch Blast* or using your Level 6 spell against groups.

# Best consumables / items (single-use)

- **Elixir of Bloodlust** — *Once per turn on kill: **5 temp HP** + **additional action***
  - **What it does:** Grants an extra Action upon downing an enemy.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** The Fiend Warlock is already focused on securing kills to gain Temporary HP. This elixir dramatically increases the Warlock's action economy, allowing them to cast *Eldritch Blast* (Action) and then another full-power *Eldritch Blast* (Elixir Action) in the same turn after a kill.
  - **When to use it:** Ideal for encounters with high enemy density where the Warlock can easily secure a kill and snowball the fight.

- **Potion of Speed** — *Extra action, +2 AC, advantage on DEX saves, double movement*
  - **What it does:** Grants an additional Action and several defensive bonuses for two turns.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** The extra action allows the Warlock to cast a leveled spell (Action) and *Eldritch Blast* (Potion Action) in the same turn, or to reposition and use a powerful Cantrip. The +2 AC helps compensate for the Warlock's lighter armor proficiency.
  - **When to use it:** Reserve for boss fights or difficult encounters where massive, rapid damage output is required to end the threat quickly.

- **Elixir of Vigilance** — ***+5 initiative**; can’t be Surprised*
  - **What it does:** Provides a large bonus to Initiative and immunity to being Surprised.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** Going first is paramount for a damage-focused caster. It allows the Warlock to use a powerful control spell (*Hypnotic Pattern*) or a high-damage AoE spell (*Fireball*) before enemies can spread out or engage, preventing damage to the party.
  - **When to use it:** Should be used daily (until Long Rest) to ensure the Warlock acts at the top of the combat order in almost every encounter.

- **Oil of Accuracy** — *Weapon coating: **+2 Attack Rolls***
  - **What it does:** Increases the Attack Roll bonus of a weapon by +2.
  - **Why it is strong for this build:** While *Eldritch Blast* is the main attack, its individual beams are considered spell attacks. This oil increases the chance of those beams connecting against high-AC targets, ensuring maximum damage from your primary Cantrip.
  - **When to use it:** Apply before boss fights or against high-AC enemies where guaranteeing hits with *Eldritch Blast* or other attack roll spells is crucial.

---

## Optional: Illithid powers (if using tadpoles)

- **Luck of the Far Realms** — *Turn a successful hit into a Critical Hit (once per Long Rest)*
  - **What it does:** Allows the caster to guarantee a critical hit on any successful attack roll.
  - **Why it synergizes with the build:** *Eldritch Blast* fires multiple beams, each of which is an attack roll. This power can be applied to any one of these hits or a high-level spell like *Disintegrate* to guarantee a massive spike of critical damage, ensuring the elimination of a priority target in one turn.

- **Cull of the Weak** — *Execute low-HP enemies; nearby creatures take Psychic damage*
  - **What it does:** When you reduce a creature’s HP to 0, enemies within a short radius take Psychic damage.
  - **Why it synergizes with the build:** The Fiend Warlock is kill-focused to maintain Temporary HP. This power adds a passive layer of AoE damage onto every kill secured by the Warlock, assisting in clearing out groups of low-health enemies (minions) after a big spell hits.

- **Psionic Backlash** — *Reaction Psychic damage when an enemy casts a spell*
  - **What it does:** Allows you to use a Reaction to deal high Psychic damage to an enemy when they cast a spell.
  - **Why it synergizes with the build:** As a caster, your reaction is often free. This provides a high-damage, resource-efficient way to punish enemy concentration and spellcasting, making you a threat even during the enemy's turn.

## Optional: Alternative build route (from the guide)
- **Warlock/Sorcerer (Sorlock)**
  - This is a common hybrid build that uses the Warlock's short-rest spell slots and Cantrip (*Eldritch Blast*) combined with the Sorcerer's **Metamagic** (especially *Quickened Spell*) and high number of spell slots. It allows for huge burst damage (e.g., *Eldritch Blast* as a Bonus Action) and far more flexibility than the pure Warlock route.
