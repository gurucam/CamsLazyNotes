- [ ] This time, head straight down to reach a room with a Mimic. Kill (or charm) it for the Deep Braille Divine
- [ ] Tome. Remember, giving this to Irina and buying any of the spells it unlocks will lock you into the bad ending of her quest. I recommend saving this for Karla, unless you really want some of the spells
- [ ] From the Mimic, head down more steps and continue straight to a room with a Deep Accursed that drops Aldrich's Sapphire upon death. There is also an Ember in this room
- [ ] Head back to the previous room and turn right to head through a door and up some steps. If you are embered, Longfinger Kirk will invade your world. He drops Barbed Straight Sword + Spiked Shield
- [ ] Kill the giant if you haven't already (the one in the larger open area) and grab the Soul of a Nameless
- [ ] Soldier and the Maiden Set
- [ ] Open the double doors next to where the giant was, head down some steps, and open another set of doors. Out here you can pick up the Saint Bident and Homeward Bone x2
- [ ] Head back up through both doors and walk forward through the water until you can turn left up some steps. You'll find a Large Soul of an Unknown Traveler against the wall
- [ ] Travel over to the other end of the large, open, water-filled area to the other giant. Kill this one and the slimes around him, and you'll be able to grab a Pale Tongue, the Drang Armor Set, and the Drang
- [ ] Hammers
- [ ] Head up the steps behind where the giant was sitting, kill the enemies around the shrine, and grab the Ember from the ledge that overlooks the water-filled area
- [ ] If you turn to face the giant shrine, you should see a door to your left. Head through and you'll reach some double doors that open back out to a previous area (near the graveyard). Staying inside the cathedral, continue past these doors to reach Siegward (if he is not here, follow the first part of the next step). Grab Duel Charm x3 to the right of him. (Note: If you've already gone to the upper rafters where you drop down to Rosaria, the following encounter will not occur)
- [ ] If Siegward is not there, leave the Cathedral completely (go to Firelink Shrine and come back) and then head back into the Cathedral through the large blue double doors you just opened. You will notice that a new bridge has been activated and Siegward is standing next to it. Talk to him and then cross the bridge to trigger a cutscene where it is revealed it was really Patches. Depending on if you killed the Giants or not, you'll either have to fight one or nothing happens
- [ ] After being lowered, turn directly around and head through the door that's directly underneath the area
- [ ] Patches was standing. Head through a door and down several sets of steps to open the final shortcut to the Cleansing Chapel bonfire
- [ ] As you head back through the shortcut you just opened, you should notice another door on your left immediately after you leave the chapel. Open it to reveal a lift, which will take you up to an area where you can climb a ladder to an enemy that drops the Deep Ring when killed
- [ ] You can drop onto a new roof through the hole in the wall just past the enemy you just killed. Head up the roof, turn right, and begin heading down this long roof. Eventually you'll be able to turn right and head down another roof to reach an Arbalest. Head back up to the long roof and head to the end to grab a Pale Tongue
- [ ] Turn around from the Pale Tongue location and head back down the long roof. Eventually, you'll be able to turn right and head back inside to the rafters of the cathedral. Head right first and grab the Blessed
- [ ] Gem near the wall
- [ ] Zig-zag your way across the rafters towards the other end, sticking primarily to the right. Eliminate the knight with the crossbow and drop down near where he was standing to a platform with a couple of candelabras. Drop again and you'll find yourself back with Patches. He will be waiting here and pretend to not be responsible for what just happened. Tell him "You know who I am" to receive the Prostration gesture. You can speak with him again for a Rusted Coin. You can then buy Siegward's Armor Set from him. (Note: Purchasing this armor means Patches will not be a rescue option for Greirat later in Irithyll of the Boreal Valley)
- [ ] Before leaving this area, continue on up the nearby stairs. Kill all the enemies and the non-agressive one will drop the Red Sign Soapstone. Continue on and you'll eventually find yourself at the Rosaria's
- [ ] Bed Chamber bonfire. Speak with Rosaria to obtain the Rosaria's Fingers covenant. For now, do not offer her any Pale Tongues if you intend to do Sirris' quest line. We'll continue this side quest closer to the end of the game
- [ ] If you killed Longfinger Kirk when he invaded earlier, you can grab the Armor of Thorns Set nearby
- [ ] If Patches didn't spawn at the Cathedral, return to Firelink Shrine and purchase the Tower Key if you haven't already and head into the Tower behind Firelink Shrine now. As you ascend the lift to the top, you'll hear a door shut behind you. Grab the Fire Keeper Soul at the top, if you haven't before, and then come back down to encounter Patches. He has locked the door and you'll need to drop down from the bridge onto coffins to escape
- [ ] Head back to the Tower and get to the bridge that overlooks Firelink Shrine. Drop down onto the roof and move around the roof until you find some windows you can go through. An Estus Shard will be on the rafters (you may have done this already in the Firelink Shrine section)
- [ ] While on the roof, you can hear Pickle-Pee, Pump-a-Rum crow. Trading a Homeward Bone will get you the Call Over gesture and the Iron Bracelets (you may have done this already in the Firelink Shrine section). For the other trade options see the Misc page
- [ ] With the Fire Keeper Soul, you can heal Dark Sigils that you have in order to completely get rid of your
- [ ] Hollowing Level. If you are following Yoel/Yuria's quest line, however, don't do this until the postgame or you'll end up angering Yoel/Yuria
- [ ] Refresh Firelink Shrine and head to the upper right to find Patches now located there. He'll ask for forgiveness; refuse to receive the Prostration gesture and a Rusted Gold Coin. You can then buy
- [ ] Siegward's Armor Set from him. Leaving Firelink Shrine and returning will allow Patches to be in his squatting position. Interact with him to receive the Patches Squat gesture
- [ ] If you can't buy Siegward's Armor Set yet, head to the Cleansing Chapel and check the well at the entrance, where Siegward should trapped. After speaking to him, return to whatever location Patches is at for you and buy the armor
- [ ] Return to the well Siegward is in and throw his armor down to him to receive the Rejoice gesture
- [ ] Head back up the steps past where you defeated the second giant. Turn right at the giant shrine. If you are embered, you can summon Anri of Astora and Horace the Hushed (both behind the shrine) as well as Sirris of the Sunless Realms (before the fog door). Defeat the Deacons of the Deep and you'll receive Small Doll + Soul of the Deacons of the Deep
- [ ] Rest at the bonfire so you can pick up the Archdeacon Set near the altar

## Farron Keep

- [ ] After defeating the Deacons of the Deep, return to Firelink Shrine to find Anri and Horace. Talk to Anri to progress the questline
- [ ] Farron Keep is a poisonous swamp, hence it might be a good idea to buy a few Purple Moss Clumps from the Shrine Handmaid. In addition, any item with the Quickstep weapon art (such as the Dagger, also sold by the Handmaid) could be useful as well since it allows you to move unimpeded through the deeper sections of the swamp
- [ ] Leave the bonfire and enter Farron Keep proper. Turn right and in the back corner you will find Purple
- [ ] Moss Clump x3. Continue into the swamp from there to find Iron Flesh between some trees
- [ ] Optionally, and only if you are on bad terms with Yuria (healed the Dark Sigil or attacked her) and are embered, head further into the deep swamp on the right. Dark spirit Londor Pale Shade will invade your world among the Basilisks there. If you kill him, you will receive the Manikin Claws
- [ ] Head back to the Farron Keep bonfire, turn left this time and in the back corner you will find Ragged
- [ ] Mask surrounded by slugs
- [ ] To the right you will see a Titanite Shard in the swamp
- [ ] Turn right, head around the island, and in front of the partially sunken stone tower you will find an Estus
- [ ] Shard
- [ ] To the left and past a large fire you'll see a Titanite Shard before the steps leading up Instead of taking these steps, turn left once more to find Prism Stone x10 on a corpse on an island
- [ ] Farther out (closer to the stone wall) you will find Stone Parma
- [ ] From there go in direction of the rock wall on the right to find Rotten Pine Resin x4 against a tree
- [ ] Follow this rocky wall to the left to reach a small structure guarded by a darkwraith. The Sage's Coal is on a body inside this structure, granting you Crystal, Blessed, and Deep infusions
- [ ] Continue on, sticking closely to the rock wall on your right until it opens to some steps, which you follow up. Go through the archway and interact with the first altar (on your left) to extinguish the flame
- [ ] Go back through the archway and pick up Rotten Pine Resin x2 ahead, then go back down the steps on this side
- [ ] As you arrive at the bottom of the steps, continue straight on into the deeper swamp until you find yourself between two ramp-like segments of a sunken bridge
- [ ] Ascend the one on your right for Purple Moss Clump x4
- [ ] Turn around, cross over to the other ramp, and pick up the Greatsword
- [ ] From there, look left to locate a stone pillar, behind which you pick up a Titanite Shard
- [ ] Looking at the fire from there, head to your right towards the rock wall and follow that to the next fire to discover a set of steps as well as another Titanite Shard. (If you stay back as far as possible while picking it up, the Ghru Leaper on the other island should not notice you)
- [ ] Head up and stick to the right to find Purple Moss Clump x2 between two trees
- [ ] Snuff out the flame on the second altar
- [ ] Cross the bridge with the three Ghrus to find the Keep Ruins bonfire
- [ ] Go down the ramp on the other side and enter the round structure to the right, where you will find an Undead Bone Shard amidst some slugs
- [ ] From the other side of this structure you can see a ladder surrounded by slugs. Go a bit past this ladder for now and pick up Wolf's Blood Swordgrass at the foot of the tower
- [ ] Step onto the nearby island to find a cauldron of Estus Soup as well as the Sunlight Talisman
- [ ] Return to the ladder you just passed and climb it
- [ ] Once you reach the top, go right (don't enter the tower) to find a Crystal Lizard on the other side who drops a Twinkling Titanite
- [ ] From the lizard go back from where you came and just before the stairs turn right to find an illusionary wall (look for an archway on the wall). Behind it you will find Dreamchaser's Ashes
- [ ] Enter the room to find the Old Wolf of Farron and his bonfire. Interact with the wolf to receive the Legion
- [ ] Etiquette gesture and join the Watchdogs of Farron covenant
- [ ] Return to Firelink Shrine and give the Dreamchaser's Ashes to the Shrine Handmaid. Reload the area and Sirris will once again be there. Talk to her to receive the Darkmoon Loyalty gesture
- [ ] Warp back to the Old Wolf of Farron bonfire and go up the tower with the elevator
- [ ] Turn right and on the top you can fight a Stray Demon to obtain Soul of a Stray Demon
- [ ] Around the Stray Demon you will find a Greataxe, an Ember, and another Ember
- [ ] Turn around and move towards the gate. Just before and to the right of the gate is a spot where you can drop down. Do so and move along, dropping down a few ledges
- [ ] After getting to the other side of the gate go left and up to find a Crystal Lizard who drops a Heavy Gem
- [ ] There are two Crystal Lizards before the dead dragon who both drop a Large Titanite Shard
- [ ] In front of the dragon you can also find Lightning Spear
- [ ] Right next to it is the Dragon Crest Shield
- [ ] Go back to the ladder that led up the tower and go down. (Note: If you don't want to use a Homeward
- [ ] Bone you can go back by going up the gate and dropping down to the other side)
- [ ] Facing away from the ladder, proceed to a small island with a Titanite Shard next to a fire
- [ ] From the next small island with a fire, make a quick detour to the left where the Nameless Knight Set is stashed between a tower and a rock wall. (Going there may trigger an invasion by Yellowfinger Heysel, but she spawns out of immediate reach on the other side of the tower)
- [ ] Up next is Titanite Shard x2 in front of a tree. (If the Elder Ghru in the area is giving you trouble, you can try luring him into one of the fires for some extra damage)
- [ ] Keep heading closely along the rocks on your left until you reach a way up. (If dark spirit Yellowfinger
- [ ] Heysel is already in your world, you might encounter her in the area upstairs)
- [ ] Go up to the altar and extinguish the last of the three flames. To the right, on the other side of the small stone wall, you'll find a Rusted Gold Coin
- [ ] Go through the archway on the left to find Homeward Bone x2
- [ ] Head up the steps, fight the Ghru Leaper (if you sprint up, you should be able to backstab him), and go down on the other side. If not triggered previously, Yellowfinger Heysel will invade you here, provided you are embered. If this is your first time defeating her, you'll gain Heysel Pick + Xanthous Crown
- [ ] In the swamp area below, you will encounter some Basilisks. If you want to beef up your curse resistance, equip Archdeacon Set and Maiden Gloves
- [ ] Take a right at the bottom of the steps and then enter an alcove on your left with a Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier
- [ ] Turn around and head to the other side of the steps. Tucked away in the dead end between rocks and tower is another Large Soul of a Nameless Soldier
- [ ] Turn around yet again and make your way across an island. To the right between two rock formations you can find Repair Powder x4
- [ ] Go right into a cave, where you will find the Golden Scroll
- [ ] Make sure to give this scroll to Orbeck at Firelink Shrine to keep him from leaving (it doesn't have to be the Golden Scroll in particular, but this is the first one available)
- [ ] Right next to the scroll is the Antiquated Set in a chest
- [ ] Warp (or walk straight along the outer walls) to the Keep Ruins bonfire. Standing at the top of the ramp leading down from there, drop off to the left, directly onto a Titanite Shard
- [ ] From here you will see a Great Crab and a white birch when looking towards the wall. Kill the crab for the Lingering Dragoncrest Ring. (Lure the crab close to the white birch tree and the Giant of the Undead
- [ ] Settlement will assist you using his greatarrows)
- [ ] Around this area you will find Gold Pine Bundle x6, an Ember, a Large Soul of an Unknown Traveler, a Soul of a Nameless Soldier, a Young White Branch, another Young White Branch, and the Crown of Dusk
- [ ] Follow the wall to your right and you'll eventually find the Sage's Scroll, guarded by Ghrus near several dead mushrooms
- [ ] If you continue in the same direction along the wall you will encounter three Elder Ghrus. Lure these enemies out one by one to get Black Bow of Pharis and Pharis's Hat. In the middle you can find a Poison Gem. (If you do not wish to engage the Elder Ghrus in melee, you can instead whittle them down using ranged weapons from up by the Keep Ruins bonfire)
- [ ] Warp (or backtrack) to the Keep Ruins bonfire, go down the ramp and through the opened gate. Straight ahead is a Shriving Stone
- [ ] Follow the path and once you're in an open area turn right and enter the structure to get to the Farron
- [ ] Keep Perimeter bonfire
- [ ] Take the path farther into the structure to encounter a Ravenous Crystal Lizard who drops Titanite
- [ ] Scale x2
- [ ] Right next to him is the Great Magic Weapon sorcery
- [ ] Open the shortcut back to the Road of Sacrifices
- [ ] Turn around and go back in direction of the bonfire. After the first set of stairs you can go through the broken wall on the left and drop down Here you can find Atonement and on the right side of the cliff you can find a Hollow Gem
- [ ] If you want to be able to access Yuria of Londor and the Usurpation of Fire ending, make sure that, before proceeding to fight the Abyss Watchers, you have Drawn Out True Strength 5 times with Yoel and then reload Firelink Shrine so that Yoel dies and Yuria appears. You can talk to her to receive the Dignified Bow gesture and buy the Londor Braille Divine Tome
- [ ] Before fighting the Abyss Watchers, remember to give Orbeck the Golden Scroll and/or Sage's Scroll
- [ ] Buy Aural Decoy, Farron Flashsword, Pestilent Mist, and Spook from Orbeck. Then talk to him multiple times to obtain the Young Dragon Ring, the Silent Ally gesture, and the Slumbering Dragoncrest Ring
- [ ] Go back to the Farron Keep Perimeter bonfire and leave the building
- [ ] To the right of the Ghrus you can find an Ember
- [ ] Go up the right side and on the hill you will find Black Bug Pellet x3
- [ ] You can summon Yellowfinger Heysel in Farron Keep right after the Keep Ruins bonfire, but only if you have offered a Pale Tongue to Rosaria, which will block you out of Sirris' quest line, so I recommend saving this part for another playthrough. You'll gain the Proper Bow gesture after her summon
- [ ] Black Hand Gotthard can be summoned and will grant you the By My Sword gesture. His summon sign is up the first set of stairs
- [ ] Sirris can also be summoned here. Her sign is to the left of the mausoleum entrance
- [ ] If you are on good terms with Yuria, you can also summon the Londor Pale Shade and gain the Duel
- [ ] Bow gesture. His summon sign is right next to the Farron Keep Perimeter bonfire. (Note: In order to be able to summon two phantoms at the same time, you have to use Dried Finger. Black Hand Gotthard and Londor Pale Shade can also be summoned for another later fight, so don't worry about getting all the gestures here at once)
- [ ] Defeat the Abyss Watchers; receive Cinders of a Lord + Soul of the Blood of the Wolf
- [ ] If you have collected all the items around the three white birch trees so far, you'll find the Hawk Ring back where the giant was in Undead Settlement

## Catacombs of Carthus

- [ ] Return to Firelink Shrine and talk with Hawkwood to receive the Farron Ring. (If Hawkwood isn't sitting on the stairs inside the Shrine, reload the area until he does)
- [ ] Reload the area, and Hawkwood should no longer be present. Hawkwood's Shield will be on the ground by a gravestone outside of Firelink Shrine, near where the dog spawns
- [ ] Eygon of Carim should also now be in Firelink Shrine. Exhaust his dialogue now so he is available for a boss fight later on Warp back to the Abyss Watchers bonfire, enter the Catacombs of Carthus and on the left side you'll find Carthus Rouge x2
- [ ] After crossing the bridge, go up the stairs to the left and then immediately turn around to your right. There is Soul of a Nameless Soldier at the end of the way
- [ ] Turn back the other way, and follow the path down a ladder. At the bottom you'll find another Soul of a Nameless Soldier
- [ ] Follow the path and in the room with the pillars strike the wall on the right side to reveal an illusory wall.

- [ ] In the next room you'll find Titanite Shard x2 in the leftmost corner
- [ ] Before heading down the giant staircase that a skeleton ball will eventually begin to roll up and down, there will be a hallway to the left you can take. Head down this way and you'll eventually run into Anri, who claims to be looking for Horace. Exhaust the dialogue

- [ ] In the next hallway you can find the Carthus Milkring on the right side behind some big vases

- [ ] Get down to the left of Anri and follow to the path the next boss
- [ ] Defeat High Lord Wolnir; receive Soul of High Lord Wolnir
- [ ] During the battle you had an opportunity to grab the Grave Warden Pyromancy Tome, but should you have not picked it up then it can now be found in the far left corner of the goblet room. Cornyx can't read this pyromancy tome, so you'll have to wait until you free Karla to turn it in

- [ ] Anri A Progress: (Slayer of Aldrich Ending) Look towards the side of the room that has some stone statues. One of these is actually a pilgrim in disguise sent by Yuria. Slash away at the statues until you find him and make sure he's dead. He'll drop the Chameleon sorcery for you as well

- [ ] Continue to the next room for a lever. Pull this lever to open the gate underneath the wyverns
- [ ] On the edge you can find a Large Soul of a Weary Warrior
- [ ] An Ember can be found left of the stairs leading up After clearing your way to the roof, you will encounter the entrance to the Dragonslayer Armour boss fight. Opposing this entrance, you will find a shortcut elevator to the entrance of Lothric Castle
- [ ] Next to the shortcut is also a Sunlight Medal
- [ ] Facing away from the Dragonslayer Armour bossfight entrance, a doorway lit by torches is to the left. Proceed through the door and up the stairs. On the right is Rusted Coin x2 as well as a chest with a Titanite Scale
- [ ] Turn around and exit using the door you can see. You will find the Red Tearstone Ring on a body to the right. Drop off the ledge to find Caitha's Chime
- [ ] Facing away from the Dragonslayer Armour bossfight entrance, head to the right and drop off the ledge to kill the Pus of Man for Titanite Chunk x2 + Ember x2. Next to it is a Soul of a Crestfallen Knight
- [ ] Inside the building, you will find a Mimic chest containing the Sunlight Straight Sword. In the same room, you will find a corpse with the Braille Divine Tome of Lothric

- [ ] Sirris can be summoned for this fight if you are friendly. Her summon sign is below the second set of stairs
- [ ] Defeat the Dragonslayer Armour; receive Soul of Dragonslayer Armour
- [ ] If Eygon of Carim has left Firelink Shrine, his dead body can now be found in Irina's original cell in the Undead Settlement, containing Morne's Great Hammer + Moaning Shield. You can then purchase
- [ ] Morne's Armor Set from the Shrine Handmaid
- [ ] There are two ends to Irina's side quest depending on your actions. (Note: If option B didn't happen yet check back after the Twin Princes fight)
- [ ] Irina A: By giving her just the Braille Divine Tome of Carim and Braille Divine Tome of Lothric, or by giving her all 4 Tomes, but not buying any dark miracles, you can make Irina a Fire Keeper. Just buy all her standard spells, plus Med Heal, Tears of Denial, Force, Bountiful Light, Blessed Weapon, and Magic
- [ ] Barrier. (If you want the Saint's Ring, be sure to purchase it now, as she will no longer offer it later.)
- [ ] She'll move to the bottom of the tower to the left of Firelink Shrine after you refresh the world and will now act as a Fire Keeper. If you did give her the Londor and Deep Tome instead of Karla, they will be on the ground beside her and you can now give them to Karla
- [ ] Irina B: If you gave Irina the Londor Braille Divine Tome or Deep Braille Divine Tome and bought ANY of these spells (Deep Protection, Gnaw, Dark Blade, Vow of Silence, or Dead Again), she will have disappeared for you sometime in the game from her normal location in Firelink Shrine. She would then be outside near the Iudex Gundyr fight area with Eygon. Eygon will believe you have killed her and is hostile. Upon killing him, you see that Irina is still actually alive, but the corruption has begun for her.
- [ ] This is an alternate way of Morne's Armor Set being available for purchase. After Irina returns to Firelink
- [ ] Shrine, buying all the dark miracles listed above will fully corrupt her and she'll no longer act as a vendor to you. Equipping Morne's Gauntlets allows her to believe you to be Eygon and she'll ask to be killed. Do so and you can give her ashes to the Shrine Handmaid to sell her miracles
