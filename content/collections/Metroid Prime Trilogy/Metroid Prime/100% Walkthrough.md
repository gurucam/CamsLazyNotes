# Metroid Prime 1 - Efficient Item Collection Guide

This guide is intended to help one achieve a **100%** item collection rate in _Metroid Prime 1_, in a mostly efficient manner. It should work for all versions of the game: GameCube, Wii, and Wii U. Scans / logbook entries are not covered. This guide was originally created as something for me to refer back to when I replay the game; I'm hoping it can be useful to you as well. It's best if you're already familiar with the game, as I won't go into too much detail on where to go, just some hints here and there. Generally speaking, I'll provide a direction to head towards, then cover item collection for each of the rooms leading up to that point. If no specific direction is given, the way forward is usually obvious.

The guide is laid out in the order that you traverse the world. Each item will have a checkbox next to it, in case you prefer to check things off as you go (I know I do). I provide a count of how many of a certain power up you should have at each point. Emphasis is used for room names.

Now that the preamble is out of the way, let's get started.

## Act I: Here We Go Again

The first third of the game is all about rapidly gaining upgrades to restore our power while progressing through new areas.

### Space Pirate Frigate

Nothing to collect here. Proceed through the intro level; defeat the Parasite Queen and chase after Meta-Ridley in your daring escape.

### Tallon Overworld

Nothing to collect here (yet). Head west then north towards the elevator leading to **Chozo Ruins West**.

### Chozo Ruins West

Head towards the northwest corner of the map to start.

- [x] **Missile [`005`] : Hive Totem** - Defeat the Hive Mecha miniboss to earn the Missile Launcher and your first missile pack.

On harder difficulties, Flaahgra might be a little more challenging than normal, because we skip two energy tanks until after defeating Flaahgra. To help with that, you can grab the energy tank right behind Hive Mecha.

Head back to _Main Plaza_ and break open the missile door on the ground floor.

- [x] **Morph Ball : Ruined Shrine** - Defeat the plated beetle "miniboss" to gain access to this classic power up.

Head back to _Arboretum_ and traverse up the room; on your way back, complete the morph ball puzzle to drain the water and unlock the door in _Energy Core_, but don't proceed through it just yet. If you're having trouble with Flaahgra, you should go through the door and go into the lower part of _Furnace_ to grab the energy tank there.

- [x] **Varia Suit : Sunchamber** - Defeat Flaahgra to gain this classic suit.

After Flaahgra, elect to take the south door from the elevator room so we can collect some goodies. Head back towards _Hive Totem_.
