## Boss: Spider Guardian (Spider Ball Acquisition)

> This is a **morph ball–only** battle. You must **scan Spider Guardian** before entering the maze.

### Pre-Scan & Enter

- [ ] At the morph tunnel entrance:
  - [ ] Switch to **Scan Visor**.
  - [ ] Wait for the **Spider Guardian** to roll by and **scan it** (only opportunity).
- [ ] Once scanned, roll into the tunnel to start the fight.

### Spider Guardian Mechanics

- [ ] Spider Guardian moves through the maze with a damaging electrical field.
- [ ] Your objective:
  - [ ] Bomb the Guardian to turn it **green**.
  - [ ] While it remains green, bomb slot(s) to redirect its path into a **blue electrical pylon**.
- [ ] If it reverts color before slot activation, bomb it again to turn green.

#### Stage 1

- [ ] Quickly bomb-jump up the left side platforms, staying far left to avoid the field.
- [ ] Loop around to the right, stopping above the blue pylon near the bomb slot.
- [ ] As the boss approaches beneath you:
  - [ ] Drop a bomb and roll away to avoid damage.
  - [ ] Repeat until the boss turns **green**.
- [ ] When green, bomb-jump up to the slot and bomb it to redirect the Guardian into the pylon.

#### Stage 2

- [ ] Drop into the **halfpipe**.
- [ ] Use Boost to get on the right-side platform at the top of the halfpipe.
- [ ] As the boss travels down the left side near you:
  - [ ] Drop down and lay bombs in its path so it hits them and turns green.
- [ ] After turning it green:
  - [ ] Boost up the left side to the top platform.
  - [ ] Bomb-jump into the slot and bomb it to divert its path into the pylon.

#### Stage 3

- [ ] Another halfpipe layout with platforms above.
- [ ] Boost to the top and wait at the gap between platforms.
- [ ] As the boss approaches from the left:
  - [ ] Drop through the gap and plant bombs as you fall to stun/color it.
- [ ] Once it turns green:
  - [ ] Return up top.
  - [ ] Roll to the bomb slot and bomb it to redirect the boss through the pylon.

#### Stage 4 (3-Slot Maze)

- [ ] Break crates in the approach area for extra health.
- [ ] There are **three bomb slots** and multiple gates; toughest phase.
- [ ] Initial tactic:
  - [ ] Go to the very bottom of the arena.
  - [ ] Wait at the gap between platforms.
  - [ ] Lay a bomb as the boss approaches, then boost away.
  - [ ] When stunned, Boost through it.
  - [ ] Repeat until the Guardian turns green.
- [ ] When green:
  - [ ] Bomb-jump between the gap and roll to **Slot 1**.
  - [ ] Only activate Slot 1 when the boss is safely on the **right side** so it doesn’t hit the gate prematurly.
- [ ] After Slot 1:
  - [ ] Return to the bottom and continue bomb/stun loops.
  - [ ] When green again:
    - [ ] Rush to Slot 1, bomb it.
    - [ ] Boost across the gap, bomb-jump up to Slot 2 and bomb it.
    - [ ] Ensure the boss hits **Pylon 2**.
- [ ] For Slot 3:
  - [ ] Turn the boss green on the far right side.
  - [ ] Quickly bomb both Slot 1 and Slot 2 again while it’s still green.
  - [ ] Boost left across the gap and up the slope to Slot 3.
  - [ ] Bomb Slot 3 while the boss is still green to redirect into the final pylon.
- [ ] When Spider Guardian hits the third pylon, the battle ends.
- [ ] Claim the **Spider Ball**.

  - [ ] Do not waste ammo while mouth is closed.
- [ ] Defense:
  - [ ] Dash away from energy shafts (Warrior Ing–style attacks).
  - [ ] When it charges, dodge to the side or underneath, then re-lock.
