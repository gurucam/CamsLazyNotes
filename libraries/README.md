# Cam’s Lazy Notes — Libraries

Download a library zip, extract it so the top-level folder name matches the library name, and drop that folder into:
`C:\Users\<USER>\AppData\Roaming\Cam's Lazy Notes\Libraries`
(or use **+ Add Library** and pick the extracted folder).

## Available Libraries
- **Baldurs Gate 3 Checklist (Sample)** — Honor Mode-friendly walkthrough/checklists. _~1 file, ~50 KB_
  - [Download ZIP](./libraries/Baldurs%20Gate%203.zip)

## How to install
1. Download the library zip.
2. Extract it; keep the top-level folder (e.g., `Baldurs Gate 3`) with the Markdown files inside.
3. Move that folder into your Libraries directory (see path above).
4. Restart the app (or reopen Libraries) to see it if it does not pop up automatically.

## Tips
- You can create your own library by zipping any folder of Markdown files and dropping it into Libraries.
- To remove a library, right-click it in the app → **Remove Library**. The folder stays on disk until you delete it.
